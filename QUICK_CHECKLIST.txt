THE PROBLEM:
-----------
❌ https://time-tracking-app-navy.vercel.app shows "Vite + React + TS" template
✅ We need it to show "Employee Time Tracking" app

THE SOLUTION:

    - Write down your GitHub repository name: _______________
    - It might be: "vite-react" or "time-tracking-app"

                      UPDATE YOUR GITHUB REPOSITORY
================================================================================

OPTION A: GitHub Desktop
------------------------

[ ] 1. Open GitHub Desktop on your computer

[ ] 2. Find repository: ______________________ (name from Step 3)

[ ] 3. If not there: File → Clone Repository → Select it

[ ] 4. Click: Repository → Show in Finder/Explorer
    - This opens the folder

[ ] 5. DELETE all files in that folder
    - Keep .git folder if you see it (it might be hidden)

[ ] 6. COPY all files from: /home/user/vite-template/
    - Paste into your GitHub repository folder

    ⚠️ PROBLEM: /home/user/vite-template/ is on a SERVER

    - Use file transfer from server to your computer
    - Ask: "How do I get these files?"

[ ] 7. Go back to GitHub Desktop
    - You'll see MANY changed files

[ ] 8. Bottom left:

[ ] 4. Configure:
    Framework: Vite
    Build Command: npm run build

================================================================================
                        THE CORE ISSUE TO SOLVE
================================================================================

📁 Your new app code is here: /home/user/vite-template/

🎯 It needs to be here: Your GitHub repository (connected to Vercel)

🚀 Then Vercel will: Automatically build and deploy it

================================================================================
                          HOW TO GET THE FILES
================================================================================

The files are on a SERVER at: /home/user/vite-template/

Options to get them:

[ ] 1. Ask me: "Create a downloadable ZIP"
    - I'll package everything for download

[ ] 2. Ask me: "Deploy using CLI"
    - I'll try command-line deployment

[ ] 3. Use file transfer if you have server access:
    - SCP, FTP, or download from your hosting panel

[ ] 4. Ask your dev team for the files

================================================================================
                        VERIFY IT WORKED
================================================================================

After deployment:

[ ] 1. Go to: https://time-tracking-app-navy.vercel.app

[ ] 2. You should see:
    ✅ "Employee Time Tracking" as title
    ✅ Language toggle (EN | ES)
    ✅ "Login as Manager" button
    ✅ "Login as Employee" button

[ ] 3. NOT see:
    ❌ "Vite + React + TS"
    ❌ "Edit src/App.tsx and save to test HMR"

[ ] 4. Click "Login as Manager"
    ✅ Should show: Alice Johnson
    ✅ Should see employee list
    ✅ Can add new employee

IF YOU SEE ALL THIS → TIME-TRACKING APP IS LOADED! 🎉
