                    ✅ READY TO DEPLOY - SIMPLE METHOD
================================================================================

I confirmed your authentication worked, but the session didn't persist in this
automated environment. No problem! Here's the EASIEST way forward:

================================================================================
OPTION 1: DRAG & DROP ON VERCEL WEBSITE ⭐ EASIEST!
================================================================================

Your built app files are ready!

STEP 1: Stay Logged In to Vercel
---------------------------------
You should still be logged in from confirming earlier.
If not, go to: https://vercel.com and log in

STEP 2: Create New Project
---------------------------
Click "Add New..." → "Project"

STEP 3: Look for Upload Option
-------------------------------
On the import page, look for:
- "Deploy from Template" area
- Or "Browse" button
- Or drag-and-drop area

STEP 4: IF you see upload/browse:
----------------------------------
I've created a package file for you!

The file is ready at:
/home/user/vite-template/time-tracking-app-dist.tar.gz (169KB)

You'll need to download this file to your computer, then upload it to Vercel.

================================================================================
OPTION 2: USE COMMAND LINE (IF YOU HAVE ACCESS)
================================================================================

If you're on Mac/Linux or have access to command line:

cd /home/user/vite-template
npx vercel login
(Enter: pamelautecht@gmail.com)
(Verify in email)
npx vercel --prod

Your URL will appear! 🎉

================================================================================
OPTION 3: SIMPLEST - I'LL GUIDE YOU THROUGH VERCEL WEBSITE
================================================================================

Tell me: "Guide me through Vercel"

And I'll give you step-by-step instructions for deploying through the
Vercel website without any downloads!

================================================================================
WHAT TO DO NOW?
================================================================================

Pick ONE:

1. "Guide me through Vercel" → I'll give you website steps
2. "I'll use command line" → I'll give you CLI commands
3. "I need help" → Tell me where you're stuck

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED:
================================================================================

Say: "Guide me through Vercel"

I'll walk you through the website method step-by-step!

It's the easiest if you don't have command line access! 🚀
