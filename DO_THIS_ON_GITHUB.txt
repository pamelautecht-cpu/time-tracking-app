================================================================================
                    📋 YOU'RE ON GITHUB - DO THIS NOW
================================================================================

You created the repository "time-tracking-app" on GitHub.

Now you should see a page with instructions that look like this:

================================================================================

...or push an existing repository from the command line

  git remote add origin https://github.com/pamelautecht-cpu/time-tracking-app.git
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main

================================================================================

✅ I've ALREADY DONE the first 2 commands for you!
✅ The code is READY to push!

NOW YOU NEED TO: **PUSH THE CODE**

================================================================================
                        HOW TO PUSH THE CODE
================================================================================

LOOK FOR THIS TEXT ON YOUR GITHUB PAGE:

"...or push an existing repository from the command line"

OR

"uploading an existing file"

================================================================================

IF YOU SEE: "...or push an existing repository from the command line"
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The code is ready locally. You need to push it.

DO THIS:

1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to: /home/user/vite-template
3. Run this ONE command:

   git push -u origin main

4. Enter your GitHub credentials:
   - Username: pamelautecht-cpu
   - Password: Use a Personal Access Token (NOT your regular password!)

   Get token from: https://github.com/settings/tokens

5. DONE! Code will be on GitHub!

================================================================================

IF YOU SEE: "uploading an existing file" (link/button)
--------------------------------------------------------

This means you'll upload files via the web interface.

DO THIS:

1. Click "uploading an existing file"

2. You'll see a page to drag files

3. PROBLEM: The files are at /home/user/vite-template/
   These files are on a SERVER, not your computer!

   SOLUTIONS:
   a) If you have access to the server:
      - Download ALL files from /home/user/vite-template/
      - Save to your computer
      - Drag them to GitHub upload page

   b) If you have GitHub Desktop:
      - Clone the repository
      - Copy files from server to local clone
      - Push via GitHub Desktop

   c) If you have terminal access to the server:
      - Use the "git push" method above

================================================================================
                    AFTER CODE IS ON GITHUB
================================================================================

Once the code is uploaded (via push or web upload):

1. Go to https://vercel.com

2. Click "Add New..." → "Project"

3. You'll see "time-tracking-app" repository

4. Click "Import"

5. Configure:
   - Framework: Vite
   - Build Command: npm run build
   - Output Directory: dist
   - Install Command: npm install

6. Click "Deploy"

7. WAIT 1-2 MINUTES

8. GET YOUR URL! (something like https://time-tracking-app-abc123.vercel.app)

9. OPEN ON YOUR PHONE!

10. YOU'LL SEE: Employee Time Tracking app (NOT "Vite + React"!)

================================================================================
                    WHERE ARE YOU STUCK?
================================================================================

Tell me:

[ ] "I see the push instructions" → Run: git push -u origin main

[ ] "I need to upload via web" → Download files from server first

[ ] "I can't access /home/user/vite-template/" → Tell me how you're accessing it

[ ] "What's a Personal Access Token?" → Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
