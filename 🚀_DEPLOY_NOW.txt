    [ ] Open GitHub Desktop
    [ ] Find repository: "time-tracking-app" or "vite-react"
    [ ] Replace all files with the new ones from vite-template folder
    [ ] Commit: "Update with time tracking app"
    [ ] Push to GitHub
    [ ] Vercel will auto-deploy in 1-2 minutes!

================================================================================

                        WHAT YOU'LL GET

================================================================================

After deployment, you'll have a URL like:
