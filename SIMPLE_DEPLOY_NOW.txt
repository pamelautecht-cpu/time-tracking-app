================================================================================
                🚀 YOU CONFIRMED! NOW DEPLOY ON VERCEL.COM
================================================================================

You're on Vercel.com. Let's create a new project and deploy your time-tracking app!

================================================================================
                    WHAT TO DO ON YOUR SCREEN NOW
================================================================================

STEP 1: Create New Project
---------------------------

[ ] Look for button: "Add New..." (usually top right)
[ ] Click it
[ ] Select "Project"

STEP 2: Choose How to Deploy
-----------------------------

You'll see options. Choose the EASIEST one for you:

OPTION A: Import from Git (if you have GitHub)
-----------------------------------------------

[ ] Click "Import Git Repository"
[ ] If you see a repository, select it
[ ] Click "Import"
[ ] Go to STEP 3 below

OPTION B: Create from GitHub (recommended)
-------------------------------------------

First, we need to push code to GitHub. On your computer:

1. Go to https://github.com
2. Create new repository: "time-tracking-app"
3. Upload files (the code is ready at /home/user/vite-template/)
4. Then go back to Vercel and import that repository

OPTION C: Template or Direct Upload
------------------------------------

[ ] Some Vercel accounts allow dragging folders
[ ] Look for "upload" or "import from folder" options
[ ] If you see it, use it!

STEP 3: Configure the Project
------------------------------

You'll see a configuration screen:

[ ] Project Name: time-tracking-app (or any name)
[ ] Framework Preset: Select "Vite"
[ ] Build Command: npm run build
[ ] Output Directory: dist
[ ] Install Command: npm install

[ ] Click "Deploy" button

STEP 4: Wait for Build
----------------------

[ ] Watch the build logs (1-2 minutes)
[ ] When you see "✓ Ready" - you're done!

STEP 5: Get Your URL
--------------------

[ ] Vercel will show you a URL like:
    https://time-tracking-app-xyz.vercel.app

[ ] COPY that URL

[ ] Open it on your phone

✅ You should see "Employee Time Tracking" app!

================================================================================
                        THE CORE PROBLEM
================================================================================

The authentication method I'm using doesn't work in this environment.

YOU need to deploy through the Vercel WEB INTERFACE instead.

================================================================================
                    WHERE ARE YOU ON VERCEL.COM?
================================================================================

Tell me what you see:

[ ] "I see the Vercel dashboard/homepage"
    → Click "Add New" → "Project"

[ ] "I see 'Create New Project' page"
    → Follow STEP 2 above

[ ] "I see 'Import Git Repository'"
    → Do you have a GitHub repo? If yes, import it
    → If no, create one first on github.com

[ ] "I see 'Configure Project' page"
    → Follow STEP 3 above

[ ] "I don't have the code files"
    → The files are at /home/user/vite-template/
    → You need to download them to your computer first

[ ] "Build failed with error"
    → Tell me the error message

[ ] "I got a URL!"
    → PERFECT! Share it with me, let's test it

================================================================================
                    MOST COMMON ISSUE
================================================================================

PROBLEM: "I can't upload the files - they're on the server"

SOLUTION OPTIONS:

1. Create GitHub repository first:
   - Go to github.com
   - Create new repo
   - Upload files via web interface
   - Then import to Vercel

2. If you have GitHub Desktop:
   - Create repository
   - Clone to your computer
   - Download /home/user/vite-template/ files
   - Copy to repo
   - Push to GitHub
   - Import to Vercel

3. Ask me:
   - "How do I get the files?"
   - "Use a different deployment method"
   - "This is too complicated, help!"
