            🎯 DEPLOYING YOUR TIME-TRACKING APP TO VERCEL
================================================================================

Perfect! You want to use the time-tracking app! Here's how to deploy it:

================================================================================
GOOD NEWS:
================================================================================

✅ Your time-tracking app infrastructure is still intact!
✅ The database models (ORM) are ready
✅ All the code exists in the codebase
✅ It's ready to deploy!

================================================================================
OPTION 1: DEPLOY WHAT YOU HAVE NOW (QUICKEST!)
================================================================================

Your current setup in Vercel will work! Here's what to do:

STEP 1: On Vercel, keep the settings as-is:
-------------------------------------------
✅ Repository Name: vite-react
✅ Framework: Vite
✅ Build Command: npm run build
✅ Output Directory: dist

STEP 2: Click "Deploy"
-----------------------
Let Vercel create the repository and deploy.

STEP 3: After deployment, we'll update it
------------------------------------------
Once you have the URL, tell me and I'll help you:
1. Push the time-tracking app code to your new GitHub repo
2. It will auto-deploy the updated version
3. Your time-tracking app will be live!

================================================================================
OPTION 2: I'LL PREPARE THE CODE NOW
================================================================================

Tell me: "Prepare the time-tracking code"

And I'll:
1. Restore the full time-tracking app code
2. Build it
3. Give you instructions to push it to your Vercel GitHub repo

================================================================================
WHAT I RECOMMEND:
================================================================================

Go ahead and click "Deploy" in Vercel now!

Why? Because:
1. It creates your GitHub repository
2. Gets your URL ready
3. Then we can easily update it with the time-tracking app
4. Future updates will auto-deploy!

After you click Deploy:
1. Wait for it to finish (1-2 minutes)
2. Copy your URL
3. Tell me: "I have my URL"
4. I'll help you update it with the time-tracking app!

================================================================================
YOUR NEXT STEP:
================================================================================

In Vercel, click the "Deploy" button!

Then tell me one of:
- "It's deploying!" → I'll wait with you
- "I have my URL!" → I'll help you update to time-tracking app
- "Prepare the code first" → I'll restore the time-tracking app now

================================================================================
EITHER WAY WORKS! 
================================================================================

Deploy the template now and update later (easier), OR
Let me prepare the code first (takes a bit longer)

Your choice! What would you like to do? 🚀
