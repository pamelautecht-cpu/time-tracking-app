                     🚀 USE APP ON YOUR PHONE - 2 STEPS
================================================================================

## WHY IT DOESN'T WORK NOW:

"localhost" ONLY works on your computer. Your phone can't see it.
That's why you get 404 errors.

You need to use your computer's IP address instead.

================================================================================

## ⚡ DO THIS NOW (2 MINUTES):

STEP 1: On your computer, run:
-------------------------------
npm run dev

(Leave this running! Don't close it!)


STEP 2: On your phone, open browser and go to:
-----------------------------------------------
http://169.254.0.21:3000

(Make sure your phone is on the SAME WiFi as your computer!)


THAT'S IT! No more 404! ✅

================================================================================

## 📝 WHAT JUST HAPPENED:

BEFORE: http://localhost:3000  (only works on computer)
NOW:    http://169.254.0.21:3000  (works on phone too!)

Your computer's IP = 169.254.0.21
Your phone can see this IP when on same WiFi!

================================================================================

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT:

This ONLY works when:
- Your computer is running "npm run dev"
- Your phone is on SAME WiFi network
- Your computer is turned on

If you turn off your computer, the app stops working.

================================================================================
