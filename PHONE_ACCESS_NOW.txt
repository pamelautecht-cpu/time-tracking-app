                  📱 ACCESS APP ON YOUR PHONE RIGHT NOW
================================================================================

## WHY IT DOESN'T WORK:

Your app is running on "localhost" - that ONLY works on your computer.
Your phone CAN'T see localhost. That's why you get 404 errors.

Think of it like this:
- Localhost = A door only you can open in your house
- Your phone = Standing outside trying to get in

You need EITHER:
1. A public URL (Vercel - works from anywhere), OR
2. Your computer's IP address (works on same WiFi)

================================================================================

## ⚡ OPTION 1: Quick Test on Phone (Same WiFi) - 2 MINUTES

Use this if you just want to TEST on your phone right now.

STEP 1: On your computer, run this command:
-------------------------------------------------
npm run dev

STEP 2: Find your computer's IP address:
-------------------------------------------------
Windows:
  - Press Windows key + R
  - Type: cmd
  - Type: ipconfig
  - Look for "IPv4 Address" under your WiFi adapter
  - Example: 192.168.1.100

Mac:
  - Click Apple menu → System Preferences → Network
  - Select Wi-Fi (left side)
  - Look for "IP Address"
  - Example: 192.168.1.100

Linux:
  - Open Terminal
  - Type: hostname -I
  - First number is your IP
  - Example: 192.168.1.100

STEP 3: On your phone:
-------------------------------------------------
  - Make sure phone is on SAME WiFi as your computer
  - Open browser
  - Type: http://YOUR_IP:3000
  - Example: http://192.168.1.100:3000
  - App should load! No 404!

⚠️ LIMITATIONS:
- Only works while your computer is running the app
- Only works on same WiFi network
- If you turn off computer, app stops working

================================================================================
