## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Still getting 404?**
- Make sure you're using the Vercel URL (https://...), NOT localhost
- localhost only works on the computer, not on phones

**Link not working?**
- Make sure you copied the link AFTER deploying to Vercel
- The link must use the Vercel URL, not localhost

**Can't install as app?**
- iPhone: Must use Safari browser
- Android: Must use Chrome browser
- The app must be deployed (public URL), not localhost
