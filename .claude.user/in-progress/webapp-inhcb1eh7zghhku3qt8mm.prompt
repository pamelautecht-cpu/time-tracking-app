You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
i don't think the time card is loaded on the site. Go to https://vercel.com ho do make sure it on the site 

Previous work summary:
## ⚠️ Here's Why It's Not Working

The URL **https://time-tracking-app-navy.vercel.app** is live, but it's showing the **old Vite template** instead of your time-tracking app.

### The Issue:
The deployed code on Vercel is the original template. Your NEW time-tracking app code is ready here in `/home/user/vite-template`, but it needs to be pushed to update the deployment.
