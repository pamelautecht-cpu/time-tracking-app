You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
"Vite + React + TS": still 

Previous work summary:
Perfect! I've pushed an update to GitHub. Vercel will automatically detect the change and redeploy. 

## ✅ What I Just Did:

Pushed a small update to GitHub to trigger Vercel to redeploy your time clock app.

## ⏱️ Wait 1-2 Minutes, Then:

**Open this link on your phone:**
```
https://time-five-phi.vercel.app/?employee=Pamela&email=pamelautecht@gmail.com
```

You should now see:
- ⏰ **Time Clock** title
- **Your name** (Pamela)
- **Live clock** showing current time
- 🟢 **Clock In** button  
- 🔴 **Clock Out** button
- 📋 **Your Time Cards** section
- 👤 **Manager View** button
- 🌐 **Language toggle** (top right corner)

## 🔄 If It Still Shows "Vite + React + TS":

1. **Wait another minute** (Vercel is rebuilding)
2. **Refresh the page** on your phone
3. **Or clear your browser cache** and try again
