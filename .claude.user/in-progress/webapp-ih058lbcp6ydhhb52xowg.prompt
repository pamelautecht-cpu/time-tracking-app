You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
I don't like the clock-in/out redesign for the employees 

Previous work summary:
Great! I'm glad the employee time card layout restructuring meets your needs. The new layout provides a clear, logical flow that follows the actual workflow:

**Clock In → Work Location → Describe Work → Start Lunch (Optional) → End Lunch (Optional) → Clock Out**

All the changes have been validated and are working correctly. The interface is now more user-friendly with:
- Clear visual hierarchy and consistent positioning
- Full-width buttons for better mobile interaction
- Icon indicators (📍 and 📝) for quick recognition
- Optional lunch break clearly labeled
- Disabled states during lunch to prevent accidental edits
- Larger, more accessible input fields

The employee time tracking app is ready to use! If you need any additional features or modifications in the future, feel free to ask.
