You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
It's working. I clicked on my info email link to the employee, and I did see my info, and I can see the manager's info

Previous work summary:
Perfect! All checks pass. Now let me create a helpful guide for you to update an employee's email to your real email address:

## ✅ Email Link Functionality - Ready to Test!

I've successfully updated the employee management system to work with localStorage. Now you can easily add your real email address to test the email link feature.

### How to Add Your Real Email:

1. **Log in as Manager** (Mike Manager)
2. **Go to the "Employees" tab**
3. **Click the "Edit" button** (pencil icon) next to any employee
4. **Update the email field** with your real email address
5. **Click "Save Changes"**
6. **Now click "Email Link to Employee"** next to that employee

### What Will Happen:

1. Your email client will open with a pre-filled message containing:
   - **To:** Your real email address
   - **Subject:** "Your Time Tracking Link"
   - **Body:** A personalized message with the employee's unique tracking link

2. Send the email to yourself

3. **Check your email** and click the link

4. The app will **automatically log you in** as that employee and take you directly to the time tracking screen

### Key Features Now Working:

✅ **Edit employee emails** through the UI  
✅ **Changes persist** in localStorage  
✅ **Email link generation** with unique employee ID  
✅ **Auto-login** when clicking the email link  
✅ **Add, edit, delete employees** - all working with localStorage  

All TypeScript checks pass! The email link functionality is fully operational and ready for testing with your real email address.
