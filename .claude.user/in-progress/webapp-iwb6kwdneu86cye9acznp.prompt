You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

Previous work summary:
Perfect! Now let me explain this clearly:

---

## 🎯 **AH! I SEE THE PROBLEM!**

You can't find the folder because **the files are on THIS SERVER**, not on your personal computer! 

Let me explain and give you the **EASIEST solution**:

---

## **🤔 WHY YOU CAN'T FIND IT:**

- `/home/user/vite-template` is on the **server** where I'm working
- It's **NOT** on your personal computer
- That's why you can't find it in your Windows File Explorer!

---

## **✅ EASY SOLUTION - 3 OPTIONS:**

### **OPTION 1: I Deploy It For You!** ⭐ **EASIEST!**

I can run the deployment command right now!

**What you do:**
1. Tell me your Vercel email address
2. I'll run the deployment
3. You check your email for verification link
4. Click the link
5. **Done!** You get your URL!

**Just say:** "Deploy it for me" and give me your email!

---

### **OPTION 2: Use Command Line**

If you have access to a terminal where these files are:

```bash
cd /home/user/vite-template
vercel login
vercel --prod
```

---

### **OPTION 3: Download the Built Files**

I can create a downloadable package for you:

1. I'll package the `dist` folder (already built!)
2. You download it
3. You upload just that folder to Vercel
4. Much smaller and easier!

---

## **🎯 MY RECOMMENDATION:**

**Say: "Deploy it for me"**

Then give me your email address, and I'll deploy it right now! It's the fastest way! 🚀

You just need to:
1. Give me your Vercel email
2. Check your email
3. Click the verification link
4. **Get your URL!**

No downloading, no folders to find - I'll handle everything! 💪

**What do you want to do?**
