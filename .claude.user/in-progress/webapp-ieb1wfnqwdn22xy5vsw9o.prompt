You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
Not working, it reloaded, but did not let me clock in. It doesn't work; the link is not working for the employee

Previous work summary:
## Database Loading Fixed + Better Error Recovery! ✓

I've fixed multiple issues to resolve the loading timeout and non-working button problem.

### What I Fixed:

**1. "Select Account Manually" Button** ✓
The button now:
- Clears the URL parameter (removes `?employee=...`)
- Resets all employee-only mode states
- Forces a reload of users from the database
- Actually works when clicked!

**2. Added "Reload Page" Button** ✓
New secondary option:
- Completely reloads the page without the URL parameter
- Fresh start if manual selection doesn't work
- Bypasses any stuck states

**3. Database Timeout Protection** ✓
Added 5-second timeout to database queries:
- If database hangs, it fails fast instead of waiting forever
- Shows error in console
- Allows fallback options to work

**4. Better Error Logging** ✓
- Logs exactly why database loading failed
- Shows error details in console
- Sets users to empty array to trigger error UI

### What You'll See Now:

**When Clicking Employee Link:**

If database loads successfully:
- ✅ Shows employee view immediately

If database times out (like your case):
- ⏱️ Shows "Loading Timeout" error after 10 seconds
- 📊 Shows "Users loaded: 0"
- 🔘 Shows TWO buttons:
  1. **"Select Account Manually"** - Try to load without employee link
  2. **"Reload Page"** - Complete page refresh

### How to Use the Buttons:

**Option 1: "Select Account Manually"**
1. Click the button
2. It clears the employee link from URL
3. Tries to load users again
4. Should show the normal account selection dropdown

**Option 2: "Reload Page"** (if #1 doesn't work)
1. Click this button
2. Completely reloads the page
3. URL is cleared (no `?employee=...`)
4. Fresh start - shows normal login screen

### Root Cause:

The database query `getAllUser()` is hanging/timing out. This could be because:
- Database isn't initialized in this E2B environment
- IndexedDB is blocked or slow
- Browser permissions issue

### Next Steps:

**Try this now:**
1. Click "Select Account Manually" button
2. Watch the console for error messages
3. Tell me what error you see

**Or if that doesn't work:**
1. Click "Reload Page" button
2. Should show normal login screen
3. You can select your account from the dropdown

The buttons should work now and give you a way to access the app even if the employee link fails!
