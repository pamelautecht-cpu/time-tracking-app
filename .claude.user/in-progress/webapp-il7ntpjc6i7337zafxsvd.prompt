You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
I'm clicking on my name, the link, and it's not showing my name, to clock in and take off the manager's info, the employees can see it 

Previous work summary:
Perfect! All checks pass. Let me create a summary of the changes:

## ✅ Employee Link Privacy - Fixed!

I've successfully implemented security measures to prevent employees from seeing manager information when accessing via email link.

### What Changed:

1. **Employee Link Mode Tracking**
   - App now tracks when a user accesses via employee email link (`?employee={id}`)
   - This mode is maintained throughout the session

2. **Restricted User Access**
   - When employee clicks email link: **only their own account is visible**
   - They cannot see managers or other employees in the dropdown
   - If they click "Logout", they only see their own name to re-select

3. **Hidden Manager Information**
   - Role labels (Employee/Manager) removed from employee link views
   - Welcome message shows only: "Welcome, [Name]" (no role displayed)
   - "Switch User" button changes to "Logout" / "Cerrar Sesión" for clarity

4. **Security Benefits**
   - Employees can't discover manager accounts exist
   - Employees can't see other employees' information
   - Each employee only sees their own time tracking data

### Employee Experience Now:

1. **Receive email** with personal tracking link
2. **Click link** → Auto-logged in immediately
3. **See only their name** and time tracking interface
4. **No visibility** of managers or system structure
5. **Click "Logout"** → Can only re-select their own account

All TypeScript checks pass! The employee link system is now secure and privacy-focused.
