You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
I got the app on my phone, it had a 404 code, not working 

Previous work summary:
Excellent! All checks pass. Now let me create a summary:

## ✅ Fixed: Employee Link Now Works on Phone!

### **The Problem:**
- Desktop: Has localStorage with your employee data → Link works ✅
- Phone: Empty localStorage (new device) → No employee data → Link fails ❌

### **The Solution - Auto-Create Employee on New Devices:**

When you click your employee link on a new device (like your phone), the app now:

1. **Detects you don't exist** in localStorage on that device
2. **Automatically creates your employee account** using the info from the link:
   - Phone number from URL
   - Email from URL
   - Uses email username as your name (e.g., "john" from "john@email.com")
3. **Logs you in immediately**
4. **Saves to phone's localStorage** for future visits

### **How It Works Now:**

**First Time on Phone:**
```
1. Click email link on phone
2. App sees: "This employee doesn't exist here yet"
3. App creates: Employee with your phone + email
4. Auto-login: Takes you to clock in/out
5. Saved: Your account is now in phone's localStorage
```

**Future Visits on Phone:**
```
1. Click link or open app
2. App finds: "You already exist in phone's localStorage!"
3. Auto-login: Direct to clock in/out
```

### **What You'll See in Console (F12 on phone if possible):**

**First time on phone:**
```
🔗 Employee link detected - preparing auto-login
=== LOADING USERS ===
⚠ No users found in localStorage - creating demo users
=== AUTO-LOGIN ATTEMPT ===
✗ Employee not found in database
🔧 Creating employee from URL parameters for new device...
✓ Employee created: yourname
✓ Auto-logging in as new employee
```

**Future times:**
```
✓ Users found in localStorage: 2
✓ Phone match! Search: "+1-234-567-8900" = User: "+1-234-567-8900"
✓ Auto-login successful for: yourname
```

### **Try It Now:**

1. **On Desktop:**
   - Log in as your employee
   - Click "Copy My Link"
   - Note the link (has your phone + email)

2. **Send to Phone:**
   - Email/text the link to yourself

3. **On Phone:**
   - Tap the link
   - Should see "Logging you in..." briefly
   - Then **directly to your clock in/out screen!**

4. **Next Time on Phone:**
   - You can bookmark the main app URL
   - Or tap the link again
   - Either way, you're auto-logged in!

### **Important Notes:**

✅ **Each device has its own localStorage** - Desktop and phone are independent
✅ **Time card data is also per-device** - Clock in/out on phone stays on phone
✅ **This is perfect for employees** - They only use their phone to clock in/out
❌ **Managers should use desktop** - To see all employees and generate reports

### **Future Enhancement Idea:**

If you want time card data to sync between devices, you would need a real backend database (not localStorage). But for now, this setup is perfect for employees who only use their phone to clock in/out!

All TypeScript checks pass! Try the link on your phone now - it should work! 🎉📱
