You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
I need to put a real email to see if it works

Previous work summary:
Perfect! I've fixed the email link functionality. Here's what I implemented:

## What Was Fixed

The email link now works properly with **automatic login**. When an employee clicks the link from their email (e.g., `?employee={userId}`), the app will:

1. **Load users from localStorage** (instant, no database delay)
2. **Detect the `employee` URL parameter** 
3. **Automatically log in the employee** and take them directly to their time tracking screen
4. **Clean up the URL** (removes the parameter after login)

## How It Works

**For Managers:**
- Click "Email Link to Employee" button next to any employee
- Opens email client with pre-filled message containing the employee's unique link

**For Employees:**
- Receive email with their personal tracking link
- Click the link → **automatically logged in** to their time tracking screen
- Can immediately clock in/out without selecting from dropdown

## Technical Changes

Added auto-login logic at `src/routes/index.tsx:259-280` that:
- Listens for when users are loaded
- Checks URL for `?employee={id}` parameter
- Finds and logs in the matching employee automatically
- Removes the parameter from URL for clean browsing

The email link functionality is now fully working! Employees can click their emailed link and start tracking time immediately.
