You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
No error message, it said loading, but it never does the employer link 

Previous work summary:
## Loading Screen Enhanced with Error Detection! ✓

I've improved the loading screen to show exactly what's wrong when the auto-login gets stuck. Now it will help us diagnose why the employee account isn't being found.

### What I Added:

**Error Detection on Loading Screen** ✓

When the loading screen appears and users have been loaded but no employee is found, it now shows:

1. **Error Message** (red box):
   - Shows the exact employee ID from the URL link
   - Explains that the account couldn't be found
   - Bilingual support (English/Spanish)

2. **Fallback Button**:
   - "Select Account Manually"
   - Allows clicking to go back to the user selection dropdown
   - Emergency escape hatch if auto-login fails

### What You'll See Now:

**Scenario 1: Auto-Login Works** ✅
- Loading screen appears briefly
- Employee view loads immediately
- Shows "My Time Tracking" with clock in/out buttons

**Scenario 2: Auto-Login Fails** ⚠️
- Loading screen appears
- After users load, red error box shows:
  ```
  Error: Could not find employee account.
  Employee ID from link: abc123xyz
  
  [Select Account Manually] button
  ```

### How to Debug:

1. **Click the employee link from email**
2. **Check what happens:**
   - If it loads your time tracking → **SUCCESS!** ✅
   - If you see the error box → **Copy the Employee ID** it shows

3. **If you see an error:**
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Look for these messages:
     ```
     Employee ID detected from URL: abc123xyz
     Attempting auto-login for employee: abc123xyz
     Available users: [{id: "...", name: "...", role: "..."}, ...]
     ```
   - **Compare** the employee ID from URL vs the IDs in "Available users"
   - Tell me what you see!

### Possible Issues:

The error will reveal one of these problems:

1. **ID Mismatch**: The ID in the link doesn't match any user's ID in the database
2. **Wrong Role**: The user exists but isn't marked as "Employee" role
3. **User Not Created**: The employee account wasn't actually created

**Try the link now** and let me know:
- Do you see the error message?
- If yes, what Employee ID does it show?
- What do the console logs say?

This will help me fix the exact issue!
