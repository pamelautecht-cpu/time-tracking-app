You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
Looks good, how do they clock out

### **How It Works:**

- Active shift displays the location prominently
- History table shows location and work description for all past shifts

**Manager View:**

**Language Toggle:**

- Instant UI language switching without page reload
- All translations are professionally done and contextually appropriate

### **Database Schema:**
- `location` field: optional string (src/sdk/database/orm/orm_time_card_entry.ts:39)
- `work_description` field: optional string (src/sdk/database/orm/orm_time_card_entry.ts:40)
- Both fields automatically included in all ORM operations

All type checks and validations pass successfully! The application is fully functional with bilingual support and the new location/work description tracking features.
