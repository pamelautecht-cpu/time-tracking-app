You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

## ✅ HERE'S HOW TO MAKE SURE TIME-TRACKING APP LOADS ON VERCEL

I've **rebuilt the app with correct paths** for Vercel deployment. Here's exactly what to do on Vercel.com:

---

### 📍 YOU'RE ON VERCEL.COM - DO THIS:

#### **Step 1: Find Your Project**
- Look for **"time-tracking-app"** in your Vercel dashboard
- Click on it

#### **Step 2: Check Settings**
- Click **"Settings"** (top menu)
- Click **"Git"** (left sidebar)
- You'll see your connected GitHub repository name (write it down!)

#### **Step 3: Verify Build Settings**
Make sure these are set correctly:
- **Framework:** Vite
- **Build Command:** `npm run build`
- **Output Directory:** `dist`
- **Install Command:** `npm install`

### 🎯 THE CORE ISSUE

**Problem:** Vercel is deploying the OLD Vite template code  
**Solution:** Update your GitHub repository with the NEW time-tracking app code

**The new code is ready at:** `/home/user/vite-template/`  
**It needs to go to:** Your GitHub repository (that Vercel watches)

---

### 🚀 TO UPDATE THE CODE:

**Option 1: GitHub Desktop** (if you have it)
1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Find your repo (name from Step 2 above)
3. Replace all files with files from `/home/user/vite-template/`
4. Commit: "Update with time tracking app"
5. Push to GitHub
6. Vercel auto-deploys in 2 minutes!

**Option 2: GitHub Web**
1. Go to github.com
2. Find your repository
3. Upload all files from `/home/user/vite-template/`
4. Vercel auto-deploys!

**Option 3: Tell Me**
- "I can't access the GitHub repo" → I'll help
- "How do I download /home/user/vite-template/?" → I'll create a package
- "Use a different method" → I'll try CLI deployment

---

### ✅ HOW TO VERIFY IT WORKED

After deploying, open: **https://time-tracking-app-navy.vercel.app**

**Should see:**
- ✅ "Employee Time Tracking" (not "Vite + React")
- ✅ Language toggle (EN | ES)
- ✅ Login as Manager / Login as Employee buttons
- ✅ Clock in/out functionality when you login

**This confirms the time-tracking app IS LOADED!** 🎉

**Where are you stuck?** Tell me and I'll guide you through that exact step!
