You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
I need to add where the employee was for the day and what they did for the day, and can you make it in both Spanish and English? 

Previous work summary:
Perfect! I've successfully implemented the complete employee time tracking application. Here's a summary of what was built:

## Implementation Complete

The Employee Time Tracking System is now fully functional with all requested features:

### **Core Features Implemented:**

1. **Real-time Clock In/Out**
   - Employees can clock in at shift start with a single button click
   - System automatically records timestamps
   - Clock out functionality with automatic hours calculation

2. **Active Shift Indicator**
   - Real-time elapsed time display updating every second
   - Visual indicator showing current clocked-in status
   - Shows clock-in timestamp and running timer

3. **Time Card History**
   - Employees can view their complete clock in/out history
   - Displays all shifts with timestamps and calculated hours
   - Shows status badges (Active/Completed) for each entry

4. **Manager Dashboard**
   - View all employee time records in one place
   - Summary statistics: Total Employees, Hours Today, Hours This Week
   - Complete visibility into all employee shifts

5. **User Roles**
   - System distinguishes between Employee and Manager roles
   - Role-based access control with different views
   - Demo users automatically created on first launch (2 employees, 1 manager)

6. **Time Card Editing**
   - Managers can edit any time card entry
   - Modify clock in/out times via datetime picker
   - Automatic recalculation of total hours on save

7. **Filtering Capabilities**
   - Filter by employee name (dropdown selection)
   - Filter by date (date picker)
   - Clear filters option
   - Real-time filter application

8. **Total Hours Calculation**
   - Automatic calculation per shift
   - Dashboard shows hours today and hours this week
   - Proper handling of active shifts (no end time yet)

9. **Data Persistence**
   - Uses platform-hosted persistent database
   - UserORM for user accounts (src/sdk/database/orm/orm_user.ts:87)
   - TimeCardEntryORM for time records (src/sdk/database/orm/orm_time_card_entry.ts:81)

### **Technical Implementation:**

- Built with React 19 and TypeScript
- Uses shadcn/ui components (Button, Card, Table, Select, Dialog, Badge, Input, Label)
- Real-time updates with React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Proper timestamp handling (Unix timestamps in seconds)
- Clean, responsive UI with gradient backgrounds
- Type-safe database operations
- All validations passing (npm run check:safe)

The application is ready to use and meets all requirements from the product brief!
