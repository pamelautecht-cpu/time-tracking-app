You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

Previous work summary:
## Enhanced Loading Screen with Full Diagnostics! ✓

I've significantly improved the loading screen to show exactly what's happening and help diagnose the issue.

### What I Added:

**1. Comprehensive Console Logging** ✓
The app now logs every step:
- When database loading starts
- How many users were loaded
- Each user's ID, name, and role
- Any errors that occur

**2. Diagnostic Information on Loading Screen** ✓
The loading screen now shows:
- **Employee ID** from the URL link
- **Number of users loaded** from database
- Updates in real-time as data loads

**3. 10-Second Timeout** ✓
- If loading takes more than 10 seconds, shows timeout error
- Prevents infinite loading
- Offers manual account selection

**4. Better Error Messages** ✓
Two types of errors:
- **"Loading Timeout"** - Database is too slow or stuck
- **"Account Not Found"** - Users loaded but employee ID doesn't match

### What You'll See Now:

**On the Loading Screen:**
```
🕐 (animated clock)

Loading your time tracking...

Employee ID: abc123xyz
Users loaded: 0
```

Then as it loads:
```
Employee ID: abc123xyz
Users loaded: 3
```

**If It Works:** ✅
- Screen progresses to "My Time Tracking"
- Shows employee's name and clock in/out buttons

**If It Fails:** ⚠️

Scenario A - **Timeout (after 10 seconds):**
```
❌ Loading Timeout

The system is taking too long to load.
Please check your internet connection or try again later.

[Select Account Manually]
```

Scenario B - **Account Not Found:**
```
❌ Account Not Found

Error: Could not find employee account.
Employee ID from link: abc123xyz

[Select Account Manually]
```

### How to Debug:

1. **Click the employee link from email**

2. **Watch the loading screen:**
   - Note the Employee ID shown
   - Watch "Users loaded:" number
   - Does it stay at 0 or increase to 3?

3. **Open browser console (F12):**
   - Look for: `"Loading users from database..."`
   - Look for: `"Users loaded: X"`
   - Look for: `"Setting users: [...]"`
   - Look for any errors in red

4. **Tell me what you see:**
   - Employee ID shown: `_______`
   - Users loaded number: `_______`
   - Console messages: `_______`
   - Any error messages: `_______`

This diagnostic information will tell us exactly where the process is failing - whether it's the database not loading, users not being created, or ID mismatch!
