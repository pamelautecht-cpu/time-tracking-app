You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
Thank you. Now I need to add to the managers' section only the pay and calculate it for each employee, and add it to the weekly report as well

Previous work summary:
Perfect! I've fixed the print layout so clock in and clock out times now display completely without cutting off. Here's what was changed:

## ✅ Print Layout Fix - Clock In/Out Times Display Completely!

### **Changes Made to Print Styles** (src/styles.css)

**1. Increased Column Widths for Clock Times:**
```
Employee Name:   11% → 10%  (slightly reduced)
Date:            7% → 6%    (slightly reduced)
Day:             6% → 5%    (reduced)
Clock In:        10% → 12%  (INCREASED by 20% - more room for full timestamp!)
Clock Out:       10% → 12%  (INCREASED by 20% - more room for full timestamp!)
Location:        12% → 11%  (slightly reduced to balance)
Work Description: 23%       (unchanged)
Lunch:           9%         (unchanged)
Hours:           12%        (unchanged)
```

**Total: Still 100% - Everything fits on one landscape page!**

**2. Enabled Text Wrapping for Clock Times:**
- **Clock In Column (4):**
  - `white-space: normal` - allows multi-line text if timestamp is long
  - `overflow: visible` - shows all text
  - `word-wrap: break-word` - wraps long timestamps properly
  - `font-size: 7pt` - slightly smaller for tighter fit
  - `line-height: 1.3` - compact line spacing
  
- **Clock Out Column (5):**
  - Same wrapping settings as clock in
  - Ensures full timestamp "1/29/2025, 9:00:00 AM" displays completely

**3. Optimized Other Columns:**
- Reduced Employee, Date, and Day columns slightly to make room
- Location reduced 1% (still wraps for long addresses)
- Work Description maintained at 23% (still wraps properly)

### **How It Works Now:**

**Clock In/Out Columns (12% each):**
- Short format: "9:00 AM" - displays on one line
- Full format: "1/29/25, 9:00 AM" - displays on one line
- Long format: "1/29/2025, 9:00:00 AM" - may wrap to 2 lines if needed
- ✅ **Full timestamp always visible - no cutting off!**

**Other Columns Still Working:**
- Employee names: wrap to 2 lines if needed (10% width)
- Location: wraps to 2 lines if needed (11% width)
- Work descriptions: wrap across multiple lines (23% width)

### **Print Preview Results:**

When you print now:
✅ **Clock In times show completely** (12% width, can wrap if needed)  
✅ **Clock Out times show completely** (12% width, can wrap if needed)  
✅ Employee names still show completely  
✅ Locations still show completely  
✅ All columns still fit on one landscape page  
✅ Text is readable at 7-7.5pt  
✅ Professional appearance maintained  

### **Example Output:**

| Employee | Date | Day | Clock In | Clock Out | Location | Work Description | Lunch | Hours |
|----------|------|-----|----------|-----------|----------|-----------------|-------|-------|
| Christopher<br>Montgomery | 1/29/25 | Mon | 1/29/25,<br>9:00 AM | 1/29/25,<br>5:00 PM | Downtown<br>Office | Completed project... | 60 min | 8.00 hrs |
| Sarah | 1/29/25 | Mon | 1/29/25,<br>8:30 AM | 1/29/25,<br>4:30 PM | Remote Work | Customer support... | 30 min | 7.50 hrs |

### **Column Width Summary:**
- **Employee**: 10% (wraps long names)
- **Date**: 6% (compact date)
- **Day**: 5% (Mon, Tue, etc.)
- **Clock In**: 12% ✅ (full timestamp)
- **Clock Out**: 12% ✅ (full timestamp)
- **Location**: 11% (wraps long locations)
- **Work Description**: 23% (wraps text)
- **Lunch**: 9% (minutes)
- **Hours**: 12% (decimal hours)

### **Validation:**
✅ TypeScript validation passed  
✅ ESLint validation passed  
✅ Code formatting applied  
✅ All columns total 100%  

The print layout now displays clock in and clock out times completely - no more cutting off! 🎉
