You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
on widow powershell, what now 

Previous work summary:
## 💻 LET ME EXPLAIN WHAT A TERMINAL IS!

You asked about "Open your terminal" - great question! Let me explain:

---

### 🤔 WHAT IS A TERMINAL?

A **terminal** (also called command line or console) is a text-based window where you type commands instead of clicking buttons.

**Visual example:**
```
user@computer:~$ 
```
This is where you type commands!

---

### 📍 HOW TO OPEN A TERMINAL

**Windows:**
1. Press `Windows key`
2. Type: `powershell`
3. Press Enter

**Mac:**
1. Press `Command + Space`
2. Type: `terminal`
3. Press Enter

**Linux:**
- Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`

---

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: WHERE IS `/home/user/vite-template/`?

**Here's the confusing part:** The folder `/home/user/vite-template/` is **NOT on your personal computer** - it's on a **remote server** or **cloud environment**!

You're probably using:
- E2B Sandbox
- Cloud IDE (like Replit, CodeSandbox)
- Remote server
- Claude Code interface

---

### 🎯 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

**Two options:**

**Option 1: If you have access to a web-based terminal**
- Look for a "Terminal" button/tab in your interface
- Click it
- Type these commands:
  ```bash
  cd /home/user/vite-template
  git push -u origin main
  ```

**Option 2: Skip the terminal entirely**
1. Go to: https://github.com/pamelautecht-cpu/time-tracking-app
2. Click "uploading an existing file"  
3. Upload the code files
4. Then deploy on Vercel

### ❓ WHERE ARE YOU ACCESSING THIS CODE FROM?

Tell me one of these so I can give you exact steps:
- "I'm using Claude Code"
- "I'm on E2B/Sandbox"
- "I have a cloud IDE"
- "I'm not sure - I'm talking to you through [describe interface]"

Once you tell me, I'll give you the EXACT steps for your situation!
