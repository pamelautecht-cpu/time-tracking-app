You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
This is not working 

Previous work summary:
Perfect! All validation passed. The code is now fixed. The clock in/out functionality should be working now with all the debugging in place. The interface shows:

- **When NOT clocked in**: Blue status box → Location field → Work Description field → Green "CLOCK IN" button
- **When clocked in**: Green status box with timer → RED "CLOCK OUT" button (in a red box) → Lunch buttons → Location/Description fields

The extensive console logging will help identify any issues. When you click "CLOCK IN", check the browser console (F12) to see detailed logs about what's happening. If it's still not working, the console logs will show exactly where the problem is occurring.
