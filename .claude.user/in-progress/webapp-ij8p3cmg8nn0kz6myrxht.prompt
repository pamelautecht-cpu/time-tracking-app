You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

Previous work summary:
Perfect! Now let me give you super simple instructions:

---

## 📍 **DON'T WORRY! LET ME HELP YOU FIND YOUR URL!**

Your URL is definitely on the Vercel page - let me show you exactly where to look!

---

## **👀 EASIEST WAY - LOOK FOR THIS:**

On your Vercel screen, **look for ANY text that:**
- ✅ Starts with `https://`
- ✅ Ends with `.vercel.app`

**That's your URL!**

---

## **🎯 WHERE TO LOOK (Choose one):**

### **Option 1: Top of the Page**

Right after "Congratulations!", you should see:

```
https://vite-react-abc123.vercel.app  ← YOUR URL!
```

**Just copy that!**

---

### **Option 2: Click "Visit" Button**

If you see a **"Visit"** button:
1. **Click it**
2. A new tab opens with your site
3. **Look at the address bar** at the top of that tab
4. **Copy the URL from there!**

---

### **Option 3: Dashboard**

If you're on the dashboard:
1. Look for your **project name** (like "vite-react")
2. **Under it** you'll see: `https://something.vercel.app`
3. **That's your URL!**

---

### **Option 4: Click Your Project**

1. **Click on your project name**
2. Look for **"Domains"** section
3. Your URL is listed there!

---

## **📝 WHAT YOUR URL LOOKS LIKE:**

It will be something like:
```
https://vite-react.vercel.app
https://vite-react-xyz123.vercel.app
https://my-project.vercel.app
```

**Always starts with `https://` and ends with `.vercel.app`**

---

## **✅ ONCE YOU FIND IT:**

1. **Click and drag** to select the URL
2. **Copy it** (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C)
3. **Paste it here** and say:

**"My URL is: https://[paste-here].vercel.app"**

---

## **🆘 STILL CAN'T FIND IT?**

**Tell me what you see on your screen:**

Say one of these:
- "I see the congratulations message"
- "I see my project list"
- "I clicked Visit"
- "I see Next Steps"

**And I'll tell you exactly where to look!**

---

## **💡 QUICK TIP:**

Just **scan your entire Vercel page** for any URL that has `.vercel.app` in it - that's YOUR URL!

**What do you see on your screen right now?** 👀
