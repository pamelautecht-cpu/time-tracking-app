You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
I'm doing what you said, and it's not going to my clock; it's going to the other fake employees. Can you link only my name so I can clock in and out 

Previous work summary:
Perfect! I've added a super easy solution for you. Here's what I did:

## ✅ Fixed: Easy "Copy My Link" Button

### **What I Added:**

When you're logged in as an **employee**, you'll now see a **"Copy My Link"** button in the top right corner, right next to the language switcher and logout button.

### **How to Use It:**

**Super Easy - 3 Steps:**

1. **Log in as your employee account**
   - Use the main app URL on your computer
   - Select your employee name
   - Log in

2. **Click "Copy My Link" button**
   - It's in the top right corner
   - The button automatically generates your fresh personal link with:
     - Your current employee ID
     - Your phone number
     - Your email address

3. **You'll see a popup with your link!**
   - The link is automatically copied to your clipboard
   - The popup shows you the full link
   - Just paste it anywhere (email, text, notes, etc.)

### **To Send to Your Phone:**

**Option 1: Email (Recommended)**
1. Click "Copy My Link"
2. Open your email
3. Compose new email to yourself
4. Paste (Ctrl+V or Cmd+V)
5. Send
6. Open email on your phone
7. Tap the link!

**Option 2: Text Message**
1. Click "Copy My Link"
2. Open your texting app
3. Send yourself a text
4. Paste the link
5. Send
6. Open on your phone
7. Tap the link!

**Option 3: Any Note App**
1. Click "Copy My Link"
2. Open Notes/Google Keep/any app
3. Paste the link
4. Sync to your phone
5. Tap the link!

### **Why This Works Better:**

✅ **Always Fresh** - Generates link with your CURRENT ID, phone, and email
✅ **One Click** - Super fast, no need to go to Employees tab
✅ **Works Every Time** - Uses your actual data from the system right now
✅ **Shows Full Link** - You can see exactly what's being copied
✅ **Bilingual** - Works in English and Spanish

### **What the Link Looks Like:**

```
https://your-app-url.com/?employee=abc-123-456&phone=+1-234-567-8900&email=your@email.com
```

This link will work on your phone and auto-log you in every time!

All TypeScript checks pass! Try it now - just log in as your employee and click "Copy My Link" in the top right! 🎉
