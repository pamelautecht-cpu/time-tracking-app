You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

What about lunch breaks  

Previous work summary:
Perfect! Let me explain how the clock out process works in the current implementation:

## How Employees Clock Out

The clock out process is simple and user-friendly:

### **When an Employee is Clocked In:**

1. **Active Shift Display** (lines 362-380)
   - A green banner shows "Currently Clocked In" with the clock-in timestamp
   - Real-time timer displays elapsed time (updates every second)
   - If location was entered at clock-in, it's displayed

2. **Optional Fields** (lines 382-399)
   - **Location field**: Employee can update/add where they worked
   - **Work Description field**: Employee can add/update what they did during their shift
   - Both fields are pre-filled if entered at clock-in
   - Both are optional - employees can leave them blank or update them

3. **Clock Out Button** (line 401)
   - Large red "Clock Out" button (or "Registrar Salida" in Spanish)
   - Full width for easy clicking
   - Prominent placement at the bottom

### **What Happens When They Click "Clock Out":**

The `handleClockOut` function (lines 309-330):

1. Records current timestamp as clock-out time
2. Calculates total hours worked (clock out time - clock in time)
3. Saves/updates location and work description fields
4. Updates the database record
5. Refreshes the view to show completed shift in history
6. Clears the input fields

### **Result:**
- Active shift banner disappears
- The shift appears in the "Time Card History" table below as "Completed"
- Shows all details: clock in, clock out, location, work description, and total hours
- Employee can immediately clock in again for a new shift if needed

The process is intentionally simple - just fill in optional details and click the big red button!
