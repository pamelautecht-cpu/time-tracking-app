You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
 code, generate a new one!

## 🚀 **GREAT! I STARTED THE DEPLOYMENT!**

I tried to deploy it with your email (**pamelautecht@gmail.com**), but Vercel needs you to verify it's really you!

---

## **✅ STEP 1: VERIFY YOUR LOGIN**

Vercel created a verification code for you. Here's what to do:

### **Click this link:**
```
https://vercel.com/oauth/device?user_code=QSZK-GSXD
```

**Or copy and paste it into your browser!**

## **📝 WHAT YOU'LL SEE:**

When you click the link, you'll see a page that says:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│  Confirm Device Login            │
│                                  │

│  [Confirm] [Cancel]              │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Just click "Confirm"!**

## **✅ STEP 2: TELL ME YOU CONFIRMED IT**

After you click Confirm, come back here and tell me:

**"I confirmed it"**

Then I'll finish the deployment and get your URL!
