You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
no app NO Click "time-tracking-app" project i dont see this 

Previous work summary:
## 🎯 I UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM!

The website `https://time-tracking-app-navy.vercel.app` is showing **"Vite + React"** template instead of your time-tracking app. This is because the GitHub repository that Vercel is deploying from has the OLD template code.

### ✅ WHAT I'VE DONE:

1. **Committed your time-tracking app code to git** - All the employee time-tracking code is ready
2. **Created step-by-step guides** - Clear instructions in `FIX_NOW.txt`, `PUSH_TO_GITHUB.md`

### 🚀 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:

**On Vercel.com right now:**

1. **Find your GitHub repository:**
   - Click "time-tracking-app" project
   - Go to Settings → Git  
   - You'll see your connected GitHub repo URL

2. **Push the new code to GitHub:**
   - Use GitHub Desktop, OR
   - Upload files directly on github.com

3. **Vercel auto-deploys:**
   - After you push to GitHub
   - Wait 1-2 minutes
   - Your time-tracking app goes live!
