You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
no it all did not work 

Previous work summary:
Perfect! I've pushed the updated code to GitHub. Vercel will automatically detect the change and redeploy your app within 1-2 minutes.

## ✅ What Just Happened:

1. **Rebuilt** the app with the time-tracking code
2. **Pushed** to GitHub - this triggers Vercel to automatically redeploy

## 📱 **Wait 1-2 Minutes, Then Test:**

**Open this link on your phone:**
```
https://time-tracking-app-219k.vercel.app/?employee=Pamela&email=pamelautecht@gmail.com
```

You should see:
- **Employee Time Tracking** app
- Your name (Pamela) auto-logged in
- **Clock In/Clock Out** buttons
- Language toggle (English/Spanish)

## ⏱️ **Give it 2 minutes for Vercel to rebuild, then try the link!**

If it still shows "Vite + React + TS", just wait another minute and refresh the page. Vercel is rebuilding it right now.
