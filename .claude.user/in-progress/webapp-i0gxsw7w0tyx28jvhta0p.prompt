You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
I need to make it into an app now i see the clock in. How do i make it an app with no 404 code 

Previous work summary:
I'll complete the deployment setup to fix the 404 error on your phone. Let me provide you with clear deployment instructions.

The issue is that your app is currently running on `localhost`, which only works on your computer. Your phone can't access localhost, so you get a 404 error. We need to deploy it to a public URL.

I've already created the `vercel.json` file needed for deployment. Now here's how to deploy:

## **Deployment Steps:**

### **Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended - Free & Easy)**

1. **Install Vercel CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy your app:**
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts:**
   - Login to Vercel (it will open a browser)
   - Confirm project settings (just press Enter for defaults)
   - Wait for deployment to complete

4. **You'll get a public URL** like:
   ```
   https://your-app-name.vercel.app
   ```

5. **Use this public URL on your phone** - This URL will work from any device!

### **Option 2: Quick Local Network Test (Faster for Testing)**

If you want to test immediately without deploying:

1. **Find your computer's IP address:**
   - **Windows:** Open Command Prompt, type `ipconfig`, look for "IPv4 Address" (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
   - **Mac/Linux:** Open Terminal, type `ifconfig`, look for `inet` (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)

2. **Make sure your phone is on the same WiFi network as your computer**

3. **Access from phone using your IP:**
   ```
   http://192.168.1.100:5173
   ```
   (Replace `192.168.1.100` with your actual IP address)

## **After Deployment:**

Once you have the public URL (from Vercel), the employee link will work perfectly on any device:

1. Open the app on your computer using the public URL
2. Go to the employee view
3. Click **"Copy My Link"** button in the header
4. Send that link to your phone (email/text)
5. Open the link on your phone - it will auto-login directly to your time clock!

**Which option do you want to try first?** I recommend deploying to Vercel for a permanent solution, but local network testing is faster if you want to verify everything works right now.
