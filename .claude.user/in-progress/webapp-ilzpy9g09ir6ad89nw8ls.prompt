You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

Subject: Time Tracking System Access

Hi Team,

Please use this system to clock in/out each day:

🔗 Link: [PASTE YOUR URL HERE]

Quick Instructions:
1. Click the link above
2. Select your name from the dropdown
3. Click "Clock In" when you start work
4. Click "Clock Out" when you finish

The system automatically tracks your hours. You can also add lunch breaks and work descriptions.

Let me know if you have any questions!

## 📱 For Mobile Users:

Show them how to "Add to Home Screen" so it appears like a regular app on their phone!

All the detailed instructions are in the **SHARING_GUIDE.md** file I just created. You can open it and follow whichever option works best for your situation!

Is there anything specific about sharing or deployment you'd like me to help with?
