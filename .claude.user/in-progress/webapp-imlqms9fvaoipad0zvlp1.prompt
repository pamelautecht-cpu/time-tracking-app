You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

Previous work summary:
Excellent! All validation passed. Now I've added extensive debugging and visual feedback to help diagnose the clock in issue. Here's what's new:

## ✅ Enhanced Clock In Debugging & Feedback

**Changes made:**

### **1. Detailed Console Logging**
When you click "CLOCK IN", you'll now see these console messages:
```
=== CLOCK IN STARTED ===
User ID: [user-id]
Location: [location]
Work Description: [description]
Current timestamp: [timestamp]
Inserting time card entry: [entry object]
Insert result: [result]
Time card entry created successfully!
Reloading time cards...
Loading time cards for user: [user-id]
Found X time cards
Active shift found: Yes/No
=== CLOCK IN COMPLETED ===
```

### **2. Loading State**
- Button shows "CLOCKING IN..." while processing
- Form fields are disabled during the process
- Shows "Please wait, processing..." message with pulse animation
- Button is grayed out while loading

### **3. Success/Error Alerts**
- Shows "✅ Successfully clocked in!" alert when it works
- Shows detailed error message if it fails

### **4. Better Error Handling**
- Catches and displays specific error messages
- Shows error details in the console

### **How to test this:**

1. **Open your browser console** (F12 → Console tab)
2. **Click the "CLOCK IN" button**
3. **Watch the console** - you'll see each step of the process
4. **Look for errors** - if clock in fails, you'll see exactly where and why

**If clock in succeeds**, you should see:
- Console shows "=== CLOCK IN COMPLETED ==="
- Alert: "✅ Successfully clocked in!"
- Page automatically shows the CLOCK OUT button

**If clock in fails**, you should see:
- Console shows "=== CLOCK IN FAILED ===" with error details
- Alert with specific error message

Please try clicking "CLOCK IN" now and let me know what you see in the console. This will help us identify exactly what's going wrong!
