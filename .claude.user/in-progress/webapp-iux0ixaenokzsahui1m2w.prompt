You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
"How do I download the files?" → I'll help you access them

Previous work summary:
## ✅ YES - PUSH THE CODE NOW!

You're on the GitHub page for your new "time-tracking-app" repository. Perfect! Here's exactly what to do:

---

### 📍 WHAT YOU SEE ON GITHUB:

You should see instructions that say:

**"...or push an existing repository from the command line"**

With commands like:
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/pamelautecht-cpu/time-tracking-app.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

✅ **I've already done the first 2 commands for you!**

---

### 🚀 NOW DO THIS - PUSH THE CODE:

**If you have terminal/command line access:**

1. Open terminal
2. Go to: `/home/user/vite-template/`
3. Run this ONE command:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
4. Enter your GitHub credentials:
   - Username: `pamelautecht-cpu`
   - Password: Use a **Personal Access Token** (get from https://github.com/settings/tokens)

5. **DONE!** Code will be on GitHub!

---

**If you DON'T have terminal access:**

Look for a link on GitHub that says **"uploading an existing file"** and click it.

Then you'll need to:
1. Download files from `/home/user/vite-template/` to your computer
2. Drag them to GitHub's upload page
3. Commit the changes

---

### 🎯 AFTER CODE IS ON GITHUB:

1. Go to **https://vercel.com**
2. Click **"Add New..." → "Project"**
3. Find **"time-tracking-app"** repository
4. Click **"Import"**
5. Configure: Framework = **Vite**, Build = `npm run build`, Output = `dist`
6. Click **"Deploy"**
7. Get your URL and open on your phone!

---

**Do you have terminal access to push, or do you need to upload via the web?**
