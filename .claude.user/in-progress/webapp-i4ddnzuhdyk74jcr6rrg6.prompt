You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
Open your terminal in /home/user/vite-template/ and run: what is this and how 

Previous work summary:
## ✅ PERFECT! Everything is Ready to Push!

I've set up everything for you using Method 4 (Terminal/Command Line). Here's what I did:

### ✅ Completed:
- Git initialized
- Configured with your email: `pamelautecht@gmail.com`
- All 46,000+ files committed
- Connected to: `https://github.com/pamelautecht-cpu/time-tracking-app.git`

---

### 🚀 NOW YOU JUST NEED TO RUN ONE COMMAND:

Open your terminal in `/home/user/vite-template/` and run:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

---

### 🔑 You'll Need a GitHub Personal Access Token:

When you run the push command, it will ask for:
- **Username:** `pamelautecht-cpu`
- **Password:** Use a Personal Access Token (NOT your regular password)

**Get the token here:** https://github.com/settings/tokens
1. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
2. Name it: "Time Tracking App"
3. Check the "repo" scope
4. Click "Generate token"
5. Copy the token (starts with `ghp_...`)
6. Paste it as your password when pushing

---

### 📱 After Push Succeeds:

1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Click "Add New..." → "Project"
3. Import "time-tracking-app" repository
4. Configure: Framework = Vite, Build = `npm run build`, Output = `dist`
5. Deploy
6. Get your URL
7. Open on your phone!

---

**Ready to push? Just run:**
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

Let me know when you've pushed and I'll help with the Vercel deployment!
