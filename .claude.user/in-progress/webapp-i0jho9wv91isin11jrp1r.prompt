You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
I need this to work 

Previous work summary:
Perfect! I've fixed the issue. Here's what was wrong and what I did:

## ✅ Fixed: "Not Working" Issue

### The Problem:
When you clicked an employee email link with an expired/invalid ID (because localStorage was cleared or you're using a different browser), the app would:
- Set `employeeLinkMode` to the employee ID
- Try to filter users by that ID
- Find zero matching users
- Show "Loading users..." **forever** (even though users were loaded)

This made it appear completely broken!

### The Solution:
I added intelligent error handling that detects when an employee link is broken and shows a helpful message instead of hanging.

### What Happens Now:

**Scenario 1: Valid Employee Link** ✅
- Click email link → Auto-login → See your time tracking

**Scenario 2: Expired/Invalid Employee Link** ✅
- Click email link → See helpful error message:
  - **"Link Expired"**
  - "This employee link is no longer valid. Please contact your manager for a new link."
  - **"Back to Login"** button to return to normal login

**Scenario 3: Normal Access** ✅
- Go to app directly → See all users with roles → Select any user

### How to Fix an Expired Link:

1. **As Manager:**
   - Log into the system
   - Go to "Employees" tab
   - Click "Email Link to Employee" next to the employee
   - This generates a **fresh link** with the current ID
   - Send the new link to the employee

2. **As Employee:**
   - Click the "Back to Login" button
   - Select your name from the full list
   - Or ask your manager for a new link

All TypeScript checks pass! The app is now much more robust and user-friendly.
