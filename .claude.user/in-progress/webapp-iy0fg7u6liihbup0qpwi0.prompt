You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
Create a repository: this is where I'm at now, do I push, create it?


Previous work summary:
## ✅ PERFECT! GitHub Repository Created!

Great job! You've created the `time-tracking-app` repository on GitHub. Now here's what to do next:

---

## 📍 YOU'RE ON GITHUB - WHAT YOU SEE NOW:

You should see a page that says:
**"Quick setup — if you've done this kind of thing before"**

And below that, instructions like:
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/pamelautecht-cpu/time-tracking-app.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

✅ **I've already done the first two commands for you!**

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEP: Upload the Code

Look on that GitHub page for the button or link that says:

**"uploading an existing file"**

Click it!

Then:

1. **You'll need to upload files from `/home/user/vite-template/`**
   - These files are on the server, not your computer
   - You'll need to download them first

2. **Once you have the files:**
   - Drag ALL of them into the GitHub upload area
   - Commit the changes

3. **After files are uploaded to GitHub:**
   - Go to https://vercel.com
   - Click "Add New" → "Project"
   - Click "Import" next to "time-tracking-app"
   - Configure: Framework = Vite, Build Command = `npm run build`, Output = `dist`
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Get your URL!
   - Open on phone!

## ❓ HOW CAN YOU ACCESS THE FILES?

The files at `/home/user/vite-template/` are on a server. Tell me:

- **"I have terminal access"** → I'll give you push commands
- **"I have GitHub Desktop"** → I'll guide you through it
- **"How do I download the files?"** → I'll help you access them
- **"This is confusing"** → I'll find a simpler way

What works best for you?
