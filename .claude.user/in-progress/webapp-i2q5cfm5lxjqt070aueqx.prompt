# Product Brief

## Goal
Enable employees to clock in and out in real-time to track their work hours, and enable managers to view and manage all employee time records.

## Features

2. **Active shift indicator** — Display current clocked-in status and elapsed time for employees currently on shift
3. **Time card history** — Employees can view their own clock in/out records with calculated hours per shift
4. **Manager dashboard** — Managers can view all employee time cards with filtering by employee name and date range
5. **User roles** — System distinguishes between employee and manager accounts with appropriate access permissions
6. **Time card editing** — Managers can manually adjust clock in/out times when corrections are needed
7. **Total hours calculation** — Automatically calculate and display hours worked per shift, per day, and per week
8. **Data persistence** — Use the platform-hosted persistent database to store user accounts, time card entries, and shift records
