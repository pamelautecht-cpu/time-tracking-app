Only managers can access the Employees tab.\n\n### \"I can't delete an employee!\"\n**Solution:** Make sure you're logged in as a Manager. Only managers can delete employees.\n\n### \"The Add Employee button is not working!\"\n**Solution:**\n1. Make sure you're on the \"Employees\" tab\n2. Make sure you're logged in as a Manager\n3. Try refreshing the page\n\n### \"I deleted someone by mistake!\"\n**Solution:** Unfortunately, there's no undo. You'll need to add them back:\n1. Click \"+ Add Employee\"\n2. Re-enter their information\n3. Note: Their old time cards should still exist in the system\n\n### \"Can I add the same person twice?\"\n**Yes, technically,** but you shouldn't! The app doesn't prevent duplicate names, so be careful to check if someone is already in the list before adding them.\n\n### \"What if I forget someone's email?\"\n**Solution:** You can use a placeholder email like:\n- `employee@company.com`\n- `temp@company.com`\n- Then edit it later when you get the real email\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Pro Tips\n\n### Tip 1: Prepare a List First\nBefore starting, create a spreadsheet with:\n- Employee names\n- Email addresses\n- Phone numbers\n- Role (Employee or Manager)\n\nThis makes adding everyone much faster!\n\n### Tip 2: Start with Managers\nAdd all managers first, then employees. This way managers can help add their team members.\n\n### Tip 3: Use Consistent Formatting\n- Names: \"First Last\" (e.g., \"John Smith\")\n- Emails: Use company email addresses\n- Phones: Use same format (e.g., \"+1 (555) 123-4567\")\n\n### Tip 4: Don't Delete, Keep for Records\nUnless you have a specific reason to delete, keep terminated employees in the system for historical payroll records.\n\n### Tip 5: Test with Yourself First\nAdd yourself as a test employee, try clocking in/out, then delete or edit it to make sure you understand the process.\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Example: Setting Up a Small Company\n\n**ABC Construction - 1 Manager, 5 Employees**\n\n### Step 1: Add Manager (Sarah)\n```\nName: Sarah Johnson\nEmail: sarah@abcconstruction.com\nPhone: +1 (555) 100-0001\nRole: Manager\n```\n\n### Step 2: Add Employees\n```\nEmployee 1:\nName: Carlos Rodriguez\nEmail: carlos@abcconstruction.com\nPhone: +1 (555) 100-0002\nRole: Employee\n\nEmployee 2:\nName: Maria Garcia\nEmail: maria@abcconstruction.com\nPhone: +1 (555) 100-0003\nRole: Employee\n\nEmployee 3:\nName: John Smith\nEmail: john@abcconstruction.com\nPhone: +1 (555) 100-0004\nRole: Employee\n\nEmployee 4:\nName: Lisa Chen\nEmail: lisa@abcconstruction.com\nPhone: +1 (555) 100-0005\nRole: Employee\n\nEmployee 5:\nName: Ahmed Hassan\nEmail: ahmed@abcconstruction.com\nPhone: +1 (555) 100-0006\nRole: Employee\n```\n\n### Result:\n✅ 1 Manager (can manage everything)\n✅ 5 Employees (can clock in/out)\n✅ Total: 6 people ready to track time!\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Summary\n\n### To Add Employee/Manager:\n**Employees tab → + Add Employee → Fill form → Select role → Save**\n\n### To Edit:\n**Employees tab → Find employee → Click ✏️ → Edit → Save Changes**\n\n### To Delete:\n**Employees tab → Find employee → Click 🗑️ → Confirm**\n\n### Remember:\n- ✅ Only Managers can add/edit/delete employees\n- ✅ Managers can do everything employees can + more\n- ✅ Deleted employees can't be recovered (but their time cards remain)\n- ✅ You can change role (Employee ↔ Manager) anytime\n\n---\n\n**That's it!

Only managers can access the Employees tab.\n\n### \"I can't delete an employee!\"\n**Solution:** Make sure you're logged in as a Manager. Only managers can delete employees.\n\n### \"The Add Employee button is not working!\"\n**Solution:**\n1. Make sure you're on the \"Employees\" tab\n2. Make sure you're logged in as a Manager\n3. Try refreshing the page\n\n### \"I deleted someone by mistake!\"\n**Solution:** Unfortunately, there's no undo. You'll need to add them back:\n1. Click \"+ Add Employee\"\n2. Re-enter their information\n3. Note: Their old time cards should still exist in the system\n\n### \"Can I add the same person twice?\"\n**Yes, technically,** but you shouldn't! The app doesn't prevent duplicate names, so be careful to check if someone is already in the list before adding them.\n\n### \"What if I forget someone's email?\"\n**Solution:** You can use a placeholder email like:\n- `employee@company.com`\n- `temp@company.com`\n- Then edit it later when you get the real email\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Pro Tips\n\n### Tip 1: Prepare a List First\nBefore starting, create a spreadsheet with:\n- Employee names\n- Email addresses\n- Phone numbers\n- Role (Employee or Manager)\n\nThis makes adding everyone much faster!\n\n### Tip 2: Start with Managers\nAdd all managers first, then employees. This way managers can help add their team members.\n\n### Tip 3: Use Consistent Formatting\n- Names: \"First Last\" (e.g., \"John Smith\")\n- Emails: Use company email addresses\n- Phones: Use same format (e.g., \"+1 (555) 123-4567\")\n\n### Tip 4: Don't Delete, Keep for Records\nUnless you have a specific reason to delete, keep terminated employees in the system for historical payroll records.\n\n### Tip 5: Test with Yourself First\nAdd yourself as a test employee, try clocking in/out, then delete or edit it to make sure you understand the process.\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Example: Setting Up a Small Company\n\n**ABC Construction - 1 Manager, 5 Employees**\n\n### Step 1: Add Manager (Sarah)\n```\nName: Sarah Johnson\nEmail: sarah@abcconstruction.com\nPhone: +1 (555) 100-0001\nRole: Manager\n```\n\n### Step 2: Add Employees\n```\nEmployee 1:\nName: Carlos Rodriguez\nEmail: carlos@abcconstruction.com\nPhone: +1 (555) 100-0002\nRole: Employee\n\nEmployee 2:\nName: Maria Garcia\nEmail: maria@abcconstruction.com\nPhone: +1 (555) 100-0003\nRole: Employee\n\nEmployee 3:\nName: John Smith\nEmail: john@abcconstruction.com\nPhone: +1 (555) 100-0004\nRole: Employee\n\nEmployee 4:\nName: Lisa Chen\nEmail: lisa@abcconstruction.com\nPhone: +1 (555) 100-0005\nRole: Employee\n\nEmployee 5:\nName: Ahmed Hassan\nEmail: ahmed@abcconstruction.com\nPhone: +1 (555) 100-0006\nRole: Employee\n```\n\n### Result:\n✅ 1 Manager (can manage everything)\n✅ 5 Employees (can clock in/out)\n✅ Total: 6 people ready to track time!\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Summary\n\n### To Add Employee/Manager:\n**Employees tab → + Add Employee → Fill form → Select role → Save**\n\n### To Edit:\n**Employees tab → Find employee → Click ✏️ → Edit → Save Changes**\n\n### To Delete:\n**Employees tab → Find employee → Click 🗑️ → Confirm**\n\n### Remember:\n- ✅ Only Managers can add/edit/delete employees\n- ✅ Managers can do everything employees can + more\n- ✅ Deleted employees can't be recovered (but their time cards remain)\n- ✅ You can change role (Employee ↔ Manager) anytime\n\n---\n\n**That's it!
