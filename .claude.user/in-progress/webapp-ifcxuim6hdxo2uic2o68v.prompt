You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

Previous work summary:
Perfect! I can see you have:
1. **"time-clock"** - Created TODAY (Feb 2, 2026 at 2:43 AM) - **This is the NEW one!**
2. **"time-tracking-app"** - Created yesterday (Feb 1) - This is the old broken one

## ✅ Click on: **"time-clock"** 

The one that was **created most recently** (just a few minutes ago).

**Why?** 
- ✅ "time-clock" = The simple, single-file app I just created
- ❌ "time-tracking-app" = The old complex one that had deployment issues

---

**Click "Import" on the "time-clock" repository** (the newer one created today at 2:43 AM).

That's the one with the simple, working time clock app! 🚀
