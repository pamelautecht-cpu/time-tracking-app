You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
ok all good

Previous work summary:
Perfect! All validation checks passed. I've successfully restructured the employee time card layout with the following improvements:

## ✅ Employee Time Card Layout - Restructured

**All changes validated successfully** - No TypeScript or ESLint errors.

### New Layout Flow (Exactly as requested):

**When NOT clocked in:**
1. **Status Display** - Shows "Not currently clocked in" with clear messaging
2. **📍 Work Location** - Input field (available before clocking in)
3. **📝 Describe Your Work** - Textarea field (available before clocking in)
4. **Clock In Button** - Large green gradient button to start shift

**When clocked in (Active Shift):**
1. **Status Display** - Shows elapsed time and clock-in time
2. **📍 Work Location** - Editable field (can update throughout shift, disabled during lunch)
3. **📝 Describe Your Work** - Editable textarea (can update throughout shift, disabled during lunch)
4. **Start Lunch (Optional)** - Orange outline button clearly marked as optional
5. **Clock Out** - Red destructive button to end shift
6. **Lunch Summary** - Shows total lunch time if taken (appears after ending lunch)

**When on lunch break:**
1. **Status Display** - Orange card showing "On Lunch Break"
2. **📍 Work Location** - Disabled (cannot edit during lunch)
3. **📝 Describe Your Work** - Disabled (cannot edit during lunch)
4. **End Lunch Button** - Large orange gradient button to end break

### Key Improvements Made:

1. **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Status → Location → Description → Actions (in that order)
2. **Consistent Layout**: Work location and description fields are always visible in the same position
3. **Optional Labels**: "Start Lunch" button clearly shows "(Optional)" / "(Opcional)"
4. **Full-Width Buttons**: All action buttons are now full-width for better mobile UX
5. **Icon Indicators**: �� for location, 📝 for work description for quick visual scanning
6. **Disabled States**: Fields are disabled during lunch break to prevent accidental edits
7. **Lunch Summary**: Shows lunch duration taken in a separate card after ending lunch
8. **Larger Textarea**: Increased work description to 4 rows for better usability
9. **Better Spacing**: Consistent 5-6 unit spacing between sections

The layout now follows a logical top-to-bottom flow that matches the actual workflow: Clock In → (Optional) Start Lunch → (Optional) End Lunch → Clock Out, with work location and description always accessible for updates throughout the shift.
