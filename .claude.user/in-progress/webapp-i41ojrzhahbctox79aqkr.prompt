You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

## ✅ **I CREATED GUIDES TO HELP YOU FIND YOUR URL!**

I understand you're confused about where the URL will appear. I've created **3 helpful guides** for you:

---

### **📍 Guide 1: WHERE_IS_MY_URL.txt**
Shows you **exactly** where your URL appears after deployment with visual diagrams.

### **🎯 Guide 2: SIMPLE_URL_GUIDE.txt**  
**Super simple** version - just the essentials about finding your URL.

### **⏱️ Guide 3: DEPLOYMENT_TIMELINE.txt**
Shows you **step-by-step** what you'll see during deployment and when the URL appears.

## **🎯 QUICK ANSWER - WHERE YOUR URL APPEARS:**

After you click "Deploy" and wait **2 minutes**, you'll see a **BIG SUCCESS SCREEN** with:

```
🎉 CONGRATULATIONS! 🎊

Your project has been deployed!

https://time-tracking-abc123.vercel.app  ⬅️ YOUR URL IS HERE!

[  Visit  ]  [ Continue ]
```

**Your URL will be in the MIDDLE of that screen!**

---

## **📝 IT LOOKS LIKE THIS:**

```
https://time-tracking-abc123.vercel.app
        │              │
        │              └── Random code
        └── Your project name
```

## **💡 WHAT TO DO:**

1. **After deployment finishes**, look for the success screen
2. **Copy the URL** from the middle of the screen
