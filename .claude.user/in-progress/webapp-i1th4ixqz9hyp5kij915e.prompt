You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

How do i give it to someone to start using it 

Previous work summary:
Excellent! I'm so glad the clock in/out functionality is now working! 🎉

The employee time tracking system is now fully operational. You can:

✅ **Clock in** - The system creates your time card entry  
✅ **See the Clock Out button** - It appears in a red box right after clocking in  
✅ **Clock out** - Ends your shift and calculates total hours worked  
✅ **Track lunch breaks** - Optional start/end lunch functionality  
✅ **Add location and work descriptions** - Document where you worked and what you did  
✅ **View time card history** - See all your past shifts  
✅ **Manager features** - Managers can view all employees, generate reports, and edit time cards  

The underlying database issue with null values has been fixed, so the system should continue working reliably going forward.

Is there anything else you'd like me to add or improve in the time tracking system?
