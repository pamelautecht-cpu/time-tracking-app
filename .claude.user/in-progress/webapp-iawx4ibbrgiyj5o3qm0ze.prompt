You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
I clicked the email to the employee, and it worked. It was emailed to the employee, but they could not choose their account with their name 

Previous work summary:
Perfect! The implementation is already set up to work automatically with all employees. Here's why it will work seamlessly when you add more employees:

## ✓ Yes, Email Links Work Automatically for All Employees!

The system is **fully dynamic** and will work for every employee you add, both now and in the future. Here's how:

### How It Works for New Employees:

**1. Dynamic User ID Generation** ✓
- Every employee gets a **unique ID** automatically when created
- The email function uses `user.id` which is unique for each employee
- No manual configuration needed

**2. Automatic Button Generation** ✓
- The employee table uses `.map(user => ...)` to iterate through **all users**
- Each employee row automatically gets their own "Email Link to Employee" button
- The button appears instantly when you add a new employee

**3. Personalized Links** ✓
- Each employee's link is unique: `?employee={their_unique_id}`
- The link is generated on-the-fly using their specific user data
- Format: `https://yoursite.com/?employee=abc123` (each ID is different)

**4. Personalized Emails** ✓
- Email automatically uses **each employee's** data:
  - `user.name` → Their name in the greeting
  - `user.email` → Their email address
  - `user.id` → Their unique link
- No manual updates required

### Example Workflow:

**Adding a new employee:**
```
1. Click "Add Employee"
2. Enter: 
   - Name: "Maria Garcia"
   - Email: "maria@example.com"
   - Phone: "555-1234"
   - Role: Employee
   - Hourly Rate: $18.00
3. Click "Save"
```

**Result - Immediately Available:**
- Maria appears in the employee table
- "Email Link to Employee" button appears automatically
- Clicking it opens email with:
  - **To:** maria@example.com
  - **Subject:** Your Time Tracking Link
  - **Body:** Hello Maria Garcia, here is your personal link: https://yoursite.com/?employee=xyz789

### Key Points:

✓ **No setup required** - Works automatically for all employees  
✓ **Unique links** - Each employee gets their own secure link  
✓ **Scales infinitely** - Works for 1 employee or 1,000 employees  
✓ **Real-time** - New employees immediately get the button  
✓ **Self-updating** - If you change an employee's name/email, the email function uses the updated data  

### Current Employees:
Your demo employees already have this feature:
- John Smith → john@example.com
- Sarah Johnson → sarah@example.com
- Any new employees you add will automatically work the same way!

You can test it right now by adding a new employee and clicking their "Email Link to Employee" button. It will work perfectly!
