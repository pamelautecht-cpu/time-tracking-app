You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
no working, no clock out

Previous work summary:
Excellent! All validation passed. I've fixed the error. Here's what was wrong and what I did:

## ✅ Fixed: RangeError - Invalid Time Value

### The Problem:
The error occurred when clicking the "Edit" button on a time card in the Manager view. The `handleEditCard` function was trying to convert timestamps to ISO format without properly validating them first. If a timestamp was `null`, `undefined`, or an invalid value, it would cause:
1. `parseInt()` to return `NaN`
2. `new Date(NaN * 1000)` to create an invalid Date
3. `toISOString()` to throw a `RangeError: Invalid time value`

### The Solution:
I created a `safeTimestampToISO` helper function that:
1. **Checks if timestamp exists** - Returns empty string if `null` or `undefined`
2. **Validates the parsed number** - Checks if `parseInt()` returns a valid number > 0
3. **Validates the Date object** - Checks if the created Date is valid using `isNaN(date.getTime())`
4. **Returns safe value** - Only converts to ISO if all checks pass, otherwise returns empty string

For the clock-in timestamp specifically, if it's invalid, it defaults to the current date/time as a fallback (since clock-in is required).

### What this fixes:
- ✅ No more crashes when editing time cards with invalid timestamps
- ✅ Handles edge cases where data might be corrupted or incomplete
- ✅ Gracefully falls back to empty fields for optional timestamps (clock out, lunch times)
- ✅ Provides a sensible default (current time) for required fields (clock in)

The error should now be resolved! Try clicking the "Edit" button on a time card again and it should open the edit dialog without crashing.
