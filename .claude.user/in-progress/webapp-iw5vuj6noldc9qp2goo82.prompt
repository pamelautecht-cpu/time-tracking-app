You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

## Email Link Functionality Improved! ✓

I've improved the "Email Link to Employee" feature with better user experience and feedback. Here's what changed:

### How It Works Now:

**When you click "Email Link to Employee":**

1. **Email client opens** 📧
   - Your default email client (Outlook, Gmail, Apple Mail, etc.) will open
   - Email will be pre-filled with:
     - **To:** employee's email address
     - **Subject:** "Your Time Tracking Link"
     - **Body:** Personalized message with their unique link

2. **Confirmation alert shows** ✅
   - After attempting to open the email client, you'll see an alert with:
     - Confirmation that it's opening email to the employee
     - The employee's link displayed in the alert
     - Instructions to copy manually if email client doesn't open

### Example Alert Message:

```
Opening email to John Smith (john@example.com)...

If your email client doesn't open, copy this link and send it manually:

https://yoursite.com/?employee=abc123xyz
```

### Important Notes:

**Why you need to click "Send" in your email client:**

⚠️ **Browsers cannot send emails directly** - This is a security feature. The browser can only:
- Open your email client
- Pre-fill the email content
- Let YOU review and send it

✅ **You must manually click "Send"** in your email client after it opens. This is normal and expected behavior for security reasons.

### Your Workflow:

1. Click "Email Link to Employee" button
2. Your email client opens with pre-filled email
3. Alert appears showing the link (you can copy if needed)
4. **Review the email in your email client**
5. **Click "Send" in your email client**
6. Employee receives the email with their link!

### Alternative: Use "Copy Employee Link"

If you prefer not to use the email feature, you can:
1. Click "Copy Employee Link" instead
2. Paste the link into any communication method:
   - Email it yourself
   - Send via text message
   - Share on Slack/Teams
   - Any messaging app

Both buttons work perfectly - choose whichever is easier for you!
