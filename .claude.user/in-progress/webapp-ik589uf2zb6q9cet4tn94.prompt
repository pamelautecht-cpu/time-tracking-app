You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
What about using the phone number? The email is not working; the link is going to the email, but it's not opening up for the employee to clock in  

Previous work summary:
Perfect! All checks pass. Here's what I've fixed to make the system work better:

## ✅ Fixed: Improved Auto-Login Experience & Debugging

### What I Fixed:

**1. Enhanced Visual Feedback**
- Added "Logging you in..." screen when employee link is being processed
- Shows clear loading state so users know something is happening
- Green pulsing clock icon indicates active login process

**2. Comprehensive Console Logging**
- Added detailed logging at every step of auto-login
- Shows exactly which ID and email are being searched
- Lists all available employees if login fails
- Makes it easy to diagnose why a link isn't working

**3. Improved Email-Based Fallback**
- Links now include BOTH employee ID and email address
- If ID doesn't match (localStorage cleared), email fallback kicks in
- Much more reliable across browsers and sessions

### What You'll See Now:

**When Clicking Employee Link:**

1. **"Logging you in..."** screen appears (green clock icon)
2. Console (F12) shows:
   ```
   === AUTO-LOGIN ATTEMPT ===
   Employee ID from URL: abc-123...
   Employee Email from URL: user@example.com
   Available users: [list of all users]
   ✓ Auto-login successful for: John Smith
   ✓ Auto-login complete - should now show employee time tracking view
   ```
3. Time tracking screen appears

**If Link is Broken:**
- Shows "Link Expired" message
- Explains what happened
- Provides "Back to Login" button

**To Debug Issues:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Click employee email link
3. Look for `=== AUTO-LOGIN ATTEMPT ===`
4. Check if the email in the URL matches an available employee
5. If not, the employee was deleted or email was changed

All TypeScript checks pass! The app now provides much better feedback about what's happening during the login process.
