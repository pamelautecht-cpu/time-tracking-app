You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
Looks good. I need to add where an employee can add sick days. 

Previous work summary:
I've reviewed the conversation history and I can see that I've already completed the task you asked about - finding your app link.

Based on your question "Where is my link", I created the file `YOUR_APP_LINK.md` which contains:

## Your App Information
- **Project ID:** `6979037d768a7cf710e2a1b7`
- **Task ID:** `6979a60cca8f147e3735eb00`

## How to Find Your Link

Your app is hosted on the **Creao platform**. To find your link:

1. **Log in to Creao** at https://creao.ai
2. **Go to your Projects** or Dashboard
3. **Find this project** (Employee Time Tracking System)
4. **Look for the "Preview" or "View App" button**
5. **Copy the URL** from your browser's address bar
6. **Share that URL** with your employees!

The URL typically follows patterns like:
- `https://[your-username].creao.ai/projects/[project-id]/`
- `https://preview.creao.ai/[project-id]/[task-id]/`

## Once You Have the Link

You can share it with employees via:
- **Email** (template included in YOUR_APP_LINK.md)
- **QR Code** (generate at qr-code-generator.com)
- **Text message**
- **Add to phone home screen** for app-like experience

## Alternative Options

If you can't find your Creao link, you can also deploy to:
- **Netlify** (free, easiest) - just drag the `dist` folder
- **Vercel** (free) - import the project
- **GitHub Pages** (free) - push to GitHub

All the detailed instructions are in the `YOUR_APP_LINK.md` file I created for you.

**The app is fully functional and ready to use** - you just need to get the URL from your Creao dashboard and share it with your employees!
