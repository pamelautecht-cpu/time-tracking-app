You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
Congratulations!

Previous work summary:
**No, don't delete it yet!** Keep the token for now - you might need it if you make updates to your app later.

## About Your GitHub Token:

✅ **Safe to keep** - It's already used and the code is pushed
✅ **You can delete it later** - After your app is fully deployed and working
✅ **You can always create a new one** - If you need it again

The warning "Make sure to copy your personal access token now" just means you can't view it again on GitHub (but you already copied it, so you're fine).
