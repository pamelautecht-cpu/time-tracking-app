You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

Previous work summary:
Excellent! All validation passed. I've completely redesigned the clocked-in interface to make it **absolutely impossible to miss the Clock Out button**. Here's what you'll now see:

## ✅ NEW SIMPLIFIED CLOCKED-IN INTERFACE

**When you're clocked in, the screen now shows (in this exact order from top to bottom):**

1. **Green banner**: "🕐 YOU ARE CLOCKED IN" with your elapsed time in huge numbers

2. **GIANT RED BOX** (impossible to miss):
   - **Text**: "⬇️ CLICK HERE TO END YOUR SHIFT ⬇️"
   - **Explanation**: "This will clock you out and save your time card"
   - **HUGE RED BUTTON**: "CLOCK OUT" (80px tall, extra large text)

3. **Optional lunch section** (below the clock out button, marked as "Optional")

4. **Collapsible details section** - Click to expand if you want to update location/description

**Key improvements:**

- Clock Out button is now **THE SECOND THING** you see (right after the status)
- It's in a **HUGE RED BOX with a thick red border**
- The button is **80px tall** (h-20) with **2xl text**
- Has arrows and clear instructions: "⬇️ CLICK HERE TO END YOUR SHIFT ⬇️"
- Location/work description are now **collapsed by default** so they don't hide the Clock Out button
- The button text is in **UPPERCASE** and **BOLD**

**The Clock Out button will NOT clock you in** - it's a red "destructive" button that only appears when you're already clocked in. The green "Clock In" button only appears when you're NOT clocked in.

Try it now and you should see the Clock Out button immediately at the top of the screen!
