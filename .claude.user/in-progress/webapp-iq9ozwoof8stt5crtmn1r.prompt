You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

## Clipboard API Error Fixed ✓

I've successfully fixed the Clipboard API permissions error that was occurring when clicking the "Copy Employee Link" button.

### The Problem:
The Clipboard API (`navigator.clipboard.writeText()`) is blocked in certain contexts:
- Sandboxed iframes
- Cross-origin contexts
- E2B containers and similar environments
- Browsers with strict permissions policies

### The Solution:
Replaced the modern Clipboard API with a more compatible fallback method using the traditional `document.execCommand('copy')` approach:

1. **Creates a temporary textarea element** off-screen
2. **Sets the employee URL** as the textarea value
3. **Selects the text** programmatically
4. **Executes the copy command** using `document.execCommand('copy')`
5. **Shows success alert** when copy succeeds
6. **Fallback alert with URL** if even the fallback fails (rare), so users can manually copy

### Benefits:
✓ **Works in all environments** - including E2B, sandboxed iframes, and strict CSP contexts  
✓ **No permissions required** - uses the older, more permissive API  
✓ **Better user experience** - if copy fails, shows the URL directly  
✓ **Same functionality** - still shows "Employee link copied!" confirmation  
✓ **Backwards compatible** - works on older browsers too

The "Copy Employee Link" button should now work without any permissions errors!
