You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
ok i don't want the employee to have access to the manager's edit, and how does the employee get their app

Previous work summary:
Perfect! Everything is working. Let me create a final summary document:

# ✅ Time Card Deletion Feature Added!

## What I Did

I've successfully added the ability to **delete time card records** to your employee time tracking app!

---

## 🎯 How to Delete Time Cards

### Quick Steps:
1. **Log in as a Manager** (only managers can delete)
2. **Click "Time Cards" tab**
3. **Find the time card** you want to delete
4. **Click the red trash icon (🗑️)** in the Actions column
5. **Confirm the deletion**

---

## ✨ What's New

### In Your App:
- ✅ **New delete button** - Red trash icon next to Edit button
- ✅ **Confirmation dialog** - Prevents accidental deletions
- ✅ **Bilingual support** - Works in both English and Spanish
- ✅ **Automatic updates** - Reports recalculate instantly after deletion
- ✅ **Manager-only** - Only managers can delete time cards (employees cannot)

### Visual Changes:
```
Before:
Actions column: [Edit]

After:
Actions column: [Edit] 🗑️
                 ↑     ↑
               Edit  Delete
```

## ⚠️ Important to Know

### Deletion is Permanent!
- ❌ **Cannot be undone** - Once deleted, it's gone forever
- ❌ **No recovery** - There's no trash bin or restore option
- ❌ **Data loss** - All time card info is permanently removed

### What Gets Deleted:
- Clock in/out times
- Location information
- Work description
- Lunch break data
- Total hours

### What Stays:
- ✅ Employee record (not affected)
- ✅ Other time cards (only selected one deleted)
- ✅ Already exported reports (files don't change)

---

## 💡 Best Practices

### Consider Editing Instead!
**Before deleting**, ask yourself:
- Can I just edit the wrong information?
- Is this a correctable mistake?
- Do I need to keep a record?

**Use Edit for:**
- Wrong times
- Incorrect location
- Missing work description
- Any fixable error

**Use Delete only for:**
- Duplicate entries
- Test/practice entries
- Completely wrong day/employee
- Entries created by mistake
