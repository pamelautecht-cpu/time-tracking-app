You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
The manager can clock out the employee, but there is no red button to clock out.  In the employee time tracking, I'm on the preview to see how it works. Can we redo the clocking in and out? If it doesn't work, maybe delete it and do it again

Previous work summary:
Excellent! All validation passed. I've added comprehensive debugging to help identify why the Clock Out button isn't working. Here's what I've done:

## ✅ Clock Out Debugging & Fixes Applied

**Changes made:**

1. **Added extensive console logging** to track the flow:
   - `handleClockIn` - Logs when clock in is clicked and each step
   - `handleClockOut` - Logs when clock out is clicked and the activeShift state
   - `loadTimeCards` - Logs how many time cards are found and if an active shift exists

2. **Added error handling** with try/catch blocks and user alerts:
   - If clock in fails, shows an alert
   - If clock out fails, shows an alert
   - If no active shift when trying to clock out, shows specific error

3. **Fixed potential button issues**:
   - Added `type="button"` to prevent form submission behavior
   - Changed `t.clockOut.toUpperCase()` to `String(t.clockOut).toUpperCase()` for safety

**How to debug this:**

1. **Open your browser's developer console** (F12 or right-click → Inspect → Console tab)

2. **Try clocking in** - You should see these console messages:
   ```
   Clock In clicked
   Creating time card entry for user: [user-id]
   Time card entry created, reloading...
   Loading time cards for user: [user-id]
   Found X time cards
   Active shift found: Yes (ID: [shift-id])
   Clock in complete, activeShift should be set
   ```

3. **Try clocking out** - You should see:
   ```
   Clock Out clicked - activeShift: [shift object]
   Clocking out - Total hours: X.XX
   Clock out successful!
   ```

**If you see an error in the console**, please share it with me and I can fix the specific issue. The console logs will tell us exactly where the problem is occurring.
