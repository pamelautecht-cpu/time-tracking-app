You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
Perfect, I need to be able to print out the whole week; it's cutting off. And will the sick days be calculated in the time card on the sick day

Previous work summary:
Perfect! I've successfully added sick day tracking functionality to your employee time tracking system. Here's what was implemented:

## ✅ Sick Day Tracking - Complete!

### **For Employees:**

**New "My Sick Days" Card** (appears at the top of employee view):
- 📅 **Add Sick Day** button to record absences
- Shows total sick hours taken
- Table displaying all sick days with:
  - Date of sick day
  - Hours taken (can be partial like 4 hours or full 8 hours)
  - Optional notes/reason
  - Delete button for each entry

**Add Sick Day Dialog:**
- Date picker (limited to past/present dates)
- Hours input (0.5 to 24 hours, in 0.5-hour increments)
- Notes field for reason (optional) - e.g., "Doctor's appointment", "Flu", etc.

### **For Managers:**

**New "Sick Days" Tab** (4th tab in manager view):
- View all employee sick days in one place
- **Filter by Employee** - see sick days for specific employee
- **Filter by Date** - find sick days on specific dates
- Shows total sick hours across all filtered results
- Table with employee name, date, hours, notes, and delete option

### **Bilingual Support:**
All labels and messages support both English and Spanish:
- English: "Sick Days", "Add Sick Day", "Hours", "Notes/Reason"
- Spanish: "Días de Enfermedad", "Agregar Día de Enfermedad", "Horas", "Notas/Razón"

### **Database:**
- Created `SickDayModel` with proper ORM integration
- Stores: user_id, sick_date, hours, notes
- Fully indexed for fast queries by user and date
- Uses same database patterns as time cards

### **Validation:**
✅ TypeScript type checking passed  
✅ ESLint validation passed  
✅ Code formatting applied

The sick day feature is now fully integrated and ready to use! Employees can track their sick days separately from their work time cards, and managers can monitor sick day usage across the team.
