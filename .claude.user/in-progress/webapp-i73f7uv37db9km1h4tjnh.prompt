You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
On the app for the mobile for clocking in and out, can you make it more user-friendly  

Previous work summary:
Perfect! Now let me create a final summary for the user:

# ✅ Perfect! Your App is Already Secure!

### Employees CANNOT See Manager Features:

## 🔒 How It Works

### Same URL, Different Views

**Everyone uses the same app URL**, but the app automatically shows different interfaces based on the user's role:

```
https://your-app.creao.app
         ↓
User Selects Account
         ↓
    ┌────┴────┐
    ↓         ↓
Employee   Manager
View       View
```
