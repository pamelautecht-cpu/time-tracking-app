You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
Don't see a red clock out, can I see it on the preview

Previous work summary:
Excellent! All validation passed. I've made the Clock Out button much more prominent and visible.

## ✅ Clock Out Button - Now Highly Visible

**Changes made to make Clock Out button more obvious:**

1. **Made it LARGER** - Changed from `h-14` to `h-16` (64px tall) and text from `text-lg` to `text-xl`
2. **Made it BOLDER** - Changed font-weight to `font-bold` 
3. **Larger icon** - Increased icon size from `w-5 h-5` to `w-6 h-6`
4. **Full-width** - Added `w-full` to all buttons so they span the entire width
5. **Added comment** - Added code comment "Clock Out Button - Always Visible" for clarity
6. **Better spacing** - Added `pt-2` padding to create clear separation from the fields above

**How to clock out:**

When you're clocked in, you'll now see a **large RED button** at the bottom that says "Clock Out" (or "Registrar Salida" in Spanish). It's always visible whether you're on lunch break or not.

The button layout is now:
- **Start Lunch** button (optional, outlined style)
- **Clock Out** button (large, bold, red/destructive style) ← This is what you click to end your shift!
