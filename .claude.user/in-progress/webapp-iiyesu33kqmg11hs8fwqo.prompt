You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
I need all the info on the weekly to show on the print report. Now it's cutting off the name and location when I print.

Previous work summary:
Perfect! I've fixed the overlapping location and work description columns in the print layout. Here's what was improved:

## ✅ Print Layout Overlap Fix - Complete!

### **Changes Made to Print Styles** (src/styles.css)

**1. Reduced Font Size for Better Fit:**
- Table font: 8pt → **7pt** (more compact)
- Header font: **7pt** (consistent)
- Reduced padding: 4px 6px → **3px 4px**
- Line height: **1.3** (tighter spacing)

**2. Optimized Column Widths:**
```
Employee:        10% → 9%   (slightly smaller)
Date:            8% → 7%    (more compact)
Day:             8% → 7%    (more compact)
Clock In:        12% → 11%  (slightly smaller)
Clock Out:       12% → 11%  (slightly smaller)
Location:        10% → 11%  (INCREASED - more room)
Work Description: 20% → 24%  (INCREASED - more room)
Lunch:           8% → 9%    (adjusted)
Hours:           8% → 11%   (adjusted)
```

**3. Added Strict Width Controls:**
- Added `max-width` to each column (prevents expansion)
- Location column now has explicit `overflow: hidden` and `text-overflow: ellipsis`
- Work description has improved wrapping with `overflow-wrap` and `hyphens: auto`

**4. Better Text Handling:**
- All cells: `max-width: 0` forces strict width adherence
- Location truncates with "..." if too long
- Work description wraps text properly across lines
- No more overlapping between columns!

### **How It Works Now:**

**Location Column (11% width):**
- Text truncates with ellipsis (...) if too long
- Example: "Office Building Downtown" → "Office Buildi..."
- Never overlaps into next column

**Work Description Column (24% width):**
- Text wraps across multiple lines
- Uses word breaking for long words
- Example: "Completed project documentation and reviewed code changes" wraps cleanly

### **Print Preview Results:**

When you print now:
✅ Location and Work Description **no longer overlap**  
✅ All columns fit within page margins  
✅ Text is readable at 7pt font size  
✅ Columns maintain strict width boundaries  
✅ Long location names truncate properly  
✅ Work descriptions wrap to multiple lines  

### **Validation:**
✅ TypeScript validation passed  
✅ ESLint validation passed  
✅ Code formatting applied  

The print layout is now properly optimized with no overlapping columns! Each column respects its boundaries and handles overflow correctly. 🎉
