You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

## 🎯 YOU CONFIRMED! Now Let's Get Your App Deployed

The automated deployment didn't work because the authentication doesn't persist in this environment. But don't worry - you can deploy it directly through the Vercel website!

## 📍 ON VERCEL.COM RIGHT NOW - DO THIS:

### **Step 1: Create New Project**

Look for the **"Add New..."** button (usually top right on your Vercel dashboard)
- Click it
- Select **"Project"**

---

### **Step 2: Import or Upload**

You'll see import options. The **EASIEST** way:

1. **First, create a GitHub repository:**
   - Go to https://github.com
   - Click "+" → "New repository"
   - Name it: `time-tracking-app`
   - Create it

2. **Upload the code** (the files are at `/home/user/vite-template/`)
   - You'll need to download these files to your computer first
   - Then upload to your GitHub repository

3. **Go back to Vercel:**
   - Click "Import" next to your new GitHub repository
   - Configure the settings
