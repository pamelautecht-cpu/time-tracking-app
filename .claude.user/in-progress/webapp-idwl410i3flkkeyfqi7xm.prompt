You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
ok need to see the (clock in) time on the print as well, it is cutting it out 

Previous work summary:
Perfect! I've fixed the print layout so employee names and locations now show completely without cutting off. Here's what was changed:

## ✅ Print Layout Fix - Full Names & Locations Display!

### **Changes Made to Print Styles** (src/styles.css)

**1. Increased Column Widths for Names & Locations:**
```
Employee Name:   9% → 11%  (INCREASED by 22% - more room for full names)
Location:        11% → 12% (INCREASED - more room for full locations)
Day:             7% → 6%   (slightly reduced)
Clock In/Out:    11% → 10% each (slightly reduced)
Work Description: 24% → 23% (slightly reduced to balance)
Hours:           11% → 12% (slightly increased)
```

**Total: Still 100% - Everything fits on one page!**

**2. Enabled Text Wrapping for Names & Locations:**
- **Employee Name Column (1):**
  - `white-space: normal` - allows multi-line text
  - `overflow: visible` - shows all text
  - `word-wrap: break-word` - wraps long names properly
  
- **Location Column (6):**
  - Same wrapping settings as employee names
  - Long locations like "Office Building Downtown" now wrap to 2 lines instead of cutting off

**3. Improved Readability:**
- Font size: 7pt → **7.5pt** (slightly larger, more readable)
- Line height: 1.3 → **1.4** (better spacing for wrapped text)
- Vertical alignment: **top** (keeps multi-line cells aligned nicely)

**4. Fixed CSS Specificity:**
- Reordered selectors to prevent CSS warnings
- More specific selectors now come last (correct cascade order)

### **How It Works Now:**

**Employee Name Column:**
- Short names: "John Smith" - displays on one line
- Long names: "Christopher Montgomery" - wraps to 2 lines
- ✅ **Full name always visible - no cutting off!**

**Location Column:**
- Short: "Office" - one line
- Medium: "Remote Work" - one line
- Long: "Downtown Office Building" - wraps to 2 lines
- ✅ **Full location always visible - no cutting off!**

**Other Columns:**
- Clock times, dates, hours - remain concise, single line
- Work descriptions - still wrap across multiple lines (23% width)

### **Print Preview Results:**

When you print now:
✅ **Employee names show completely** (wrap to 2 lines if needed)  
✅ **Locations show completely** (wrap to 2 lines if needed)  
✅ All columns still fit on one landscape page  
✅ Text is readable at 7.5pt  
✅ Better vertical spacing with line-height 1.4  
✅ Professional appearance maintained  

### **Example Output:**

| Employee | Date | Day | Clock In | Clock Out | Location | Work Description | Lunch | Hours |
|----------|------|-----|----------|-----------|----------|-----------------|-------|-------|
| Christopher<br>Montgomery | 1/29/25 | Mon | 9:00 AM | 5:00 PM | Downtown<br>Office Bldg | Completed project... | 60 min | 8.00 hrs |
| Sarah Johnson | 1/29/25 | Mon | 8:30 AM | 4:30 PM | Remote Work | Customer support... | 30 min | 7.50 hrs |

### **Validation:**
✅ TypeScript validation passed  
✅ ESLint validation passed  
✅ Code formatting applied  
✅ CSS specificity warnings fixed  

The print layout now displays all employee names and locations in full - no more cutting off! 🎉
