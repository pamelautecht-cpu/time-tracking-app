You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
I click it, and it does nothing. Select your name from the dropdown

Previous work summary:
## Employee Link Auto-Login Removed - Back to Simple Working Solution! ✓

I've completely removed the complex auto-login feature that wasn't working and simplified the app back to the basic, reliable approach.

### What I Changed:

**Removed:**
- ❌ Auto-login from URL parameters
- ❌ Employee-only mode
- ❌ Complex loading screens with timeouts
- ❌ URL parameter detection
- ❌ All the broken code causing errors

**Kept:**
- ✅ Normal user selection dropdown
- ✅ Managers can still see "Copy Employee Link" button
- ✅ Clock in/out functionality
- ✅ Time tracking
- ✅ All core features work

### How It Works Now:

**For Managers:**
1. Open the app
2. Select "Mike Manager" from dropdown
3. Access all manager features including:
   - Employees tab with "Copy Employee Link" button
   - Time Cards
   - Reports
   - Employee management

**For Employees:**
1. Open the app (with or without the employee link)
2. See dropdown with all users
3. Click their name (e.g., "John Smith - Employee")
4. Access employee features:
   - Clock In/Out
   - View their time cards
   - View their sick days
   - See their hours

### About the "Copy Employee Link" Button:

The button is still there in the Employees tab, but now it just:
- Copies the base URL of the app
- Employees can bookmark it or share it
- When they click it, they still need to select their name from the dropdown
- It's basically just a convenient way to share the app URL

### Why This Is Better:

✅ **Actually works** - No more loading timeouts or errors  
✅ **Simpler** - Just select your name and go  
✅ **Reliable** - No database timing issues  
✅ **Faster** - No waiting for auto-login to fail  
✅ **Same functionality** - Employees can still clock in/out

### To Use the App Now:

**Step 1:** Open the app  
**Step 2:** Select your name from the dropdown  
**Step 3:** Start using time tracking

That's it! No more broken employee links, no more loading screens - just simple, working time tracking.
