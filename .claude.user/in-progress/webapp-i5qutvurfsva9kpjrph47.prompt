You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
So, will the email link work when I add more employees 

Previous work summary:
## Email Employee Link Feature Added ✓

I've successfully added the email functionality to send employee links directly to their email addresses!

### What's New:

**1. "Email Link to Employee" Button** ✓
- Added next to the "Copy Employee Link" button in the Employees tab
- Only appears for employees (not managers)
- Blue/default styling to stand out as the primary action

**2. Email Functionality** ✓
When you click the "Email Link to Employee" button:
- Opens your **default email client** (Outlook, Gmail app, Apple Mail, etc.)
- **Pre-fills the employee's email address** from their profile
- **Pre-filled subject line**:
  - English: "Your Time Tracking Link"
  - Spanish: "Tu Enlace de Registro de Tiempo"
- **Pre-filled email body** with:
  - Personal greeting using employee's name
  - The employee's unique tracking link
  - Instructions on how to use it
  - Professional closing
  - Fully translated for English and Spanish

**3. Bilingual Support** ✓
- English: "Email Link to Employee"
- Spanish: "Enviar Enlace por Correo"
- Email content automatically matches the current language setting

### How It Works:

**Manager's Workflow:**
1. Go to **Employees** tab
2. Find the employee you want to send the link to
3. Click **"Email Link to Employee"** button
4. Your email client opens with everything pre-filled:
   - To: employee@example.com
   - Subject: "Your Time Tracking Link"
   - Body: Personalized message with their unique link
5. Review and send the email!

**Example Email (English):**
```
To: john@example.com
Subject: Your Time Tracking Link

Hello John Smith,

Here is your personal time tracking link:

https://yoursite.com/?employee=abc123

Use this link to clock in/out and track your hours.

### Benefits:
✓ **One-click email** - No need to copy/paste manually  
✓ **Professional formatting** - Pre-written, bilingual messages  
✓ **Personalized** - Uses employee's name and email  
✓ **Flexible** - You can still edit the email before sending  
✓ **Works everywhere** - Uses mailto: links (universal support)  
✓ **Both options available** - Copy link OR email it directly

Now managers can easily share employee links either by copying them or sending them directly via email!
