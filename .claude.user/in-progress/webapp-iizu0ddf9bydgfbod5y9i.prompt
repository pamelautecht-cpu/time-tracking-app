You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

Excellent! Since you clicked "Deploy", Vercel is now building your time clock app. 

## 🎉 What's Happening Now:

Vercel is deploying your simple time clock app. Within 1-2 minutes, you'll get a URL.

## 📱 To Find Your URL:

Look for one of these on your Vercel screen:

1. **Big URL at the top** that looks like:
   ```
   https://time-clock-xxxxx.vercel.app
   ```

2. **"Visit" button** - Click it to see your app

3. **Or go to your dashboard**: https://vercel.com/pamelautecht-cpus-projects/time-clock

## 🔗 Once You See the URL:

**Copy it and paste it here**, then I'll create your personal links for you and all your employees!

The URL will look something like:
- `https://time-clock-abc123.vercel.app`
