You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
i don't see  clock out button 

Previous work summary:
Excellent! All validation passed. I've removed the confusing "Add Time Card" button from the employee view. Now it's much clearer:

## ✅ Simplified Employee Clock In/Out Interface

**What I removed:**
- The "Add Time Card" button from the employee view (top right corner)
- The manual entry dialog for employees

**Why this is better:**
- **Employees** now only see the Clock In/Out interface - they click "Clock In" when they start work and "Clock Out" when they finish
- **Managers** still have the "Add Time Card" button in their view to manually add or edit time entries for employees (useful for corrections or forgotten clock-ins)

**How it works now:**
1. **Employees**: Just use the Clock In/Out buttons for real-time tracking
2. **Managers**: Can view all time cards AND manually add/edit entries if needed

This eliminates the confusion - employees don't need to worry about "adding" time cards, they just clock in and out naturally!
