You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

Previous work summary:
Perfect! All validation checks passed. The mobile UX improvements are complete and working correctly. Here's what I accomplished:

## ✅ Mobile Clock In/Out Interface - User-Friendly Improvements Complete

**All changes validated successfully** - No TypeScript or ESLint errors.

### Key Mobile UX Enhancements Made:

**1. Larger Touch Targets (Accessibility Compliant)**
- Primary "Clock In" button: 64px height (h-16) with xl text
- All action buttons: 56px height (h-14) with lg text  
- Input fields: 48px height (h-12) with base text
- All exceed the 44px minimum touch target guideline

**2. Enhanced Visual Hierarchy**
- Elapsed time timer: Massive 3xl/4xl font, tabular numbers for consistency
- Status cards: Larger circular icon backgrounds (p-2/p-3)
- Clear color coding: Green (active), Orange (lunch), Blue (not clocked)
- Gradient background on primary Clock In button for visual prominence

**3. Better Visual Feedback**
- Added shadow effects (shadow-md, shadow-lg) with hover states
- Smooth transitions on all interactive elements
- Emojis for quick visual scanning (📍 location, 🍽️ lunch)
- Circular backgrounds around icons for better focus

**4. Improved Information Architecture**
- "Not clocked in" state now has centered large icon with clear call-to-action
- Location and lunch info displayed inline with emojis
- Better spacing (gap-3, gap-4) for thumb-friendly tapping
- Responsive grid that stacks on mobile (flex-col → sm:grid)

**5. Mobile-First Responsive Design**
- Text sizes scale up on larger screens (text-lg → md:text-xl)
- Layout adapts from single column to grid
- "Add Time Card" button hidden on mobile, shown on desktop

The employee clock in/out interface is now **significantly more user-friendly on mobile devices** with larger buttons, clearer visual feedback, and easier-to-read information. All changes follow mobile UX best practices and accessibility guidelines.
