You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
The link is still not mine. I'm in my clock in and copied the link to my email, and when I open the email and click the link, it says expired login, then it goes to the other employee 

Previous work summary:
Perfect! I've fixed the auto-login issue. Here's what I did:

## ✅ Fixed: Employee Link Now Goes Directly to YOUR Clock In/Out

### **What Was Wrong:**
- When you clicked your employee link, it was showing the user selection screen with all employees
- The auto-login wasn't happening fast enough, so you saw the employee list first

### **What I Fixed:**

**1. Immediate User Select Screen Hiding**
- As soon as the app detects URL parameters (`?employee=...&phone=...&email=...`), it IMMEDIATELY hides the user selection screen
- You won't see the employee list at all anymore

**2. Better Loading Screen**
- While auto-login is happening, you'll see a nice loading screen that says:
  - "Logging you in..."
  - "Taking you to your time clock"
- Green pulsing clock icon shows progress

**3. Better Error Handling**
- If auto-login fails (wrong phone/email), it will show you the employee list with only YOUR name
- Console logs tell you exactly what went wrong

### **How It Works Now:**

**Step-by-Step Flow:**
1. **Click your employee link** (from email/text)
2. **See "Logging you in..." screen** (green clock animation)
3. **Auto-login happens** (finds you by phone number)
4. **Directly to your clock in/out screen** - NO employee selection!

### **To Test Right Now:**

1. **On your computer:**
   - Log in as your employee account
   - Click **"Copy My Link"** button (top right)
   - The popup shows your link and copies it

2. **Test in a new tab:**
   - Open a new incognito/private window
   - Paste the link
   - You should see:
     - "Logging you in..." (briefly)
     - Then YOUR time clock screen directly!

3. **Send to your phone:**
   - Email/text the link to yourself
   - Open on your phone
   - Tap the link
   - Should go straight to YOUR clock in/out screen!

### **What You Should See (Console F12):**

```
🔗 Employee link detected - preparing auto-login
=== LOADING USERS ===
✓ Users found in localStorage: 4
=== AUTO-LOGIN ATTEMPT ===
Employee Phone from URL: +1-234-567-8900
Attempted phone-based lookup for: +1-234-567-8900 Found: true
✓ Auto-login successful for: Your Name
✓ Auto-login complete - should now show employee time tracking view
```

### **Why It Works Now:**

✅ **No More Employee List** - Selection screen is hidden immediately  
✅ **Direct Auto-Login** - Phone number lookup is super reliable  
✅ **Loading Feedback** - You see progress while logging in  
✅ **Faster** - No intermediate screens to click through  

All TypeScript checks pass! Try it now - the link should take you DIRECTLY to your clock in/out screen without showing other employees! 🎉
