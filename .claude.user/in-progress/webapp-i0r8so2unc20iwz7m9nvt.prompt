You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
no it keeps clocking me in. Where do I go to clock out, and can I see it on the preview?

Previous work summary:
Excellent! All validation passed. I've made significant improvements to make the Clock Out button impossible to miss:

## ✅ Clock Out Button - Now Extremely Visible!

**Major changes to ensure the Clock Out button is always visible:**

1. **Debug indicator** - Added a green checkmark message at the top showing "✓ Currently clocked in (Shift ID: ...)" so you can confirm you're clocked in

2. **Visual separator** - Added a horizontal line between the lunch button and clock out section

3. **Red highlighted box** - The Clock Out button is now inside a **red/pink background box** with a red border to make it stand out

4. **Instructional text** - Added text above the button saying "End your shift by clicking below"

5. **Button styling** - The Clock Out button remains:
   - Full width (`w-full`)
   - Extra large height (64px / `h-16`)
   - Extra large text (`text-xl`)
   - Bold font (`font-bold`)
   - Red destructive variant
   - Large shadow effects

**What you should now see when clocked in:**

1. At the top: Green text "✓ Currently clocked in (Shift ID: xxx...)"
2. Status card showing your elapsed time
3. Location and Work Description fields
4. "Start Lunch" button (optional)
5. A horizontal line separator
6. **A RED/PINK BOX containing:**
   - Text: "End your shift by clicking below"
   - Large red "Clock Out" button

The Clock Out button should now be completely unmissable! Can you try clocking in again and let me know if you can see it now?
