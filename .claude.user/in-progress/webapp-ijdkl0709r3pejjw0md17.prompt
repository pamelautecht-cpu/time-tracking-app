You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

Personal access tokens (classic) function like ordinary OAuth access tokens. They can be used instead of a password for Git over HTTPS, or can be used to authenticate to the API over Basic Authentication.

Previous work summary:
Perfect! The code is now on GitHub! 

## ✅ Step 1 Complete: Code Pushed to GitHub

Now let's deploy it to Vercel:

## 🚀 Next Steps - Deploy on Vercel:

1. **Go to Vercel:** https://vercel.com
2. **Click:** "Add New..." → "Project"
3. **Import your repository:**
   - You should see "time-tracking-app" in the list
   - Click "Import" next to it
4. **Configure:**
   - Framework Preset: **Vite**
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
5. **Click:** "Deploy"

Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment, then you'll get your URL!

**Your app will be live at:** `https://time-tracking-app-[something].vercel.app`

Then you can open that URL on your phone and it will work! 📱

Let me know when you get to the Vercel page and I'll guide you through the import!
