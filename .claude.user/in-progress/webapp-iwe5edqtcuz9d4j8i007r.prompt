You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
Perfect!! it worked 

Previous work summary:
Perfect! All checks pass. Now let me create a comprehensive guide for you:

## ✅ Fixed: Added Comprehensive Debugging & Phone Numbers to Demo Users

### What I Fixed:

**1. Added Detailed Console Logging**
   - Every time you add/edit an employee, you'll see exactly what's being saved
   - When the app loads, you'll see exactly what users are loaded from localStorage
   - This will help you understand why you're seeing demo users vs real users

**2. Added Phone Numbers to Demo Users**
   - John Smith: +1-555-0001
   - Sarah Johnson: +1-555-0002
   - Mike Manager: +1-555-0003

**3. Enhanced Debugging Messages**
   - Clear warnings when demo users are created
   - Verification messages after saving

### **How to See What's Happening** (Press F12):

When you open the console (F12), you'll now see:

**When App Loads:**
```
=== LOADING USERS ===
Checking localStorage for key: timetracking_users
✓ Users found in localStorage: 4
User details: [
  {name: "Your Real Name", email: "your@email.com", phone: "+1-234-567-8900", role: 1},
  {name: "John Smith", email: "john@example.com", phone: "+1-555-0001", role: 1},
  ...
]
```

**When You Add an Employee:**
```
=== ADDING NEW EMPLOYEE ===
Name: Your Real Name
Email: your@email.com
Phone: +1-234-567-8900
Role: 1
Hourly Rate: 20
✓ Employee saved! Total users now: 4
```

**When You Edit an Employee:**
```
=== EDITING EMPLOYEE ===
Editing user ID: abc-123...
New Name: Your Updated Name
New Phone: +1-999-888-7777
✓ Employee updated! Total users: 4
```

### **Why You're Seeing Demo Users:**

If you see demo users, it's because localStorage was cleared. This happens when:
1. **Browser cleared cookies/data**
2. **Using Incognito/Private mode**
3. **Different browser**
4. **Manually cleared site data**

### **Solution - Add Your Employee Now:**

1. **Log in as Manager** (use Mike Manager for now)
2. **Go to Employees tab**
3. **Click "Add Employee"** button
4. **Fill in YOUR information:**
   - Name: [Your Real Name]
   - Email: [Your Real Email]
   - Phone: [Your Real Phone Number] - **VERY IMPORTANT!**
   - Role: Employee
   - Hourly Rate: [Your Rate]
5. **Click "Save Changes"**
6. **Open Console (F12)** and you should see:
   ```
   ✓ Employee saved! Total users now: 4
   ```
7. **Now generate the link:**
   - Find your name in the employee list
   - Click "Email Link to Employee" or "Copy Employee Link"
8. **The link will include your phone number:**
   ```
   ?employee={id}&phone={your-phone}&email={your-email}
   ```

### **Test the Link:**

1. Open the link in a new tab or send it to yourself
2. Console (F12) will show:
   ```
   === AUTO-LOGIN ATTEMPT ===
   Employee Phone from URL: +1-234-567-8900
   Attempted phone-based lookup for: +1-234-567-8900 Found: true
   ✓ Auto-login successful for: Your Real Name
   ```
3. You should see your time tracking screen!

All TypeScript checks pass! The app now has comprehensive debugging to help you understand exactly what's happening with your data.
