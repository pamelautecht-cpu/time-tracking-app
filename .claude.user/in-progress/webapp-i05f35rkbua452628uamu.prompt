You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
I don't understand the clock in/out and the add time card. Why are there two

Previous work summary:
Perfect! I've reverted the clock-in/out design back to the previous version that you preferred. All validation checks passed successfully.

## ✅ Clock-In/Out Layout Reverted

**Changes made:**
- Removed the emoji icons (📍 and 📝) from the labels
- Removed the "Optional" text from the lunch button
- Changed buttons back to the two-column grid layout (not full-width)
- Restored the original conditional rendering (fields hidden during lunch)
- Removed the separate lunch summary section
- Changed textarea back to 3 rows instead of 4
- Location and work description info now shows inline within the status card
- Restored the original label text ("Where did you work?" and "What did you do today?")

The interface is now back to the mobile-friendly design with:
- Large touch-friendly buttons (h-14 and h-16)
- Clear status displays with circular icon backgrounds
- Two-column button layout on larger screens, stacked on mobile
- Location and lunch info displayed as emojis within the status card
- Clean, streamlined appearance
