You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

Previous work summary:
Excellent! Everything is ready. Now let me create a final simple guide for you:

---

## ✅ **YES! I CAN HELP YOU DEPLOY IT!**

I've created an **automated script** that will do most of the work for you!

---

## **🚀 SUPER SIMPLE - TWO WAYS:**

### **WAY 1: Automated Script** ⚡ **I DO THE WORK**

I created a script called `auto-deploy.sh` that will deploy your app automatically!

**What you need to do:**

1. **Run this command:**
   ```bash
   bash auto-deploy.sh
   ```

2. **Enter your email** when prompted

3. **Check your email** for verification link

4. **Click the link**

5. **Wait 2 minutes** - the script does everything else!

6. **Get your URL** like `https://time-tracking-xyz.vercel.app`

7. **Use it on your phone** - NO MORE 404! ✅

---

### **WAY 2: Website Method** 🖱️ **CLICK AND DRAG**

If the script doesn't work, use the website method:

**Follow this file:** `✅_EASY_CHECKLIST.txt`

It's a simple checklist:
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Sign up
3. Drag your folder
4. Click Deploy
5. Get your URL!

---

## **📝 WHICH ONE SHOULD YOU DO?**

**If you're comfortable with command line:**
→ Run: `bash auto-deploy.sh`

**If you prefer clicking and dragging:**
→ Follow: `✅_EASY_CHECKLIST.txt`

**Both get the same result - your app on the internet!**

---

## **🎯 WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW:**

**Open your terminal and run:**
```bash
cd /home/user/vite-template
bash auto-deploy.sh
```

**OR**

**Open the file:** `✅_EASY_CHECKLIST.txt` and follow the steps!

---

## **💬 TELL ME:**

Which method do you want to try?

1. **"Run the script"** - I'll help you with the automated deployment

Either way, I'll help you every step of the way! 💪

Your app is ready to deploy - let's get it on your phone! 🎉
