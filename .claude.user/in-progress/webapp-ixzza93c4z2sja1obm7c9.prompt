You now have project files in the /home/user/vite-template directory. This is a continuation of your previous work - you should continue developing from the code you've already written.

Please first review the existing code files to understand the current state of the project, then directly modify or extend the corresponding code based on the user's new requirements.

Please start writing code immediately without asking the user any further questions. If you need to create new files or modify existing files, please proceed directly. Your goal is to complete all necessary code changes according to the user's requirements to make the project run properly.

User requirement:
"Use our time-tracking app"

Previous work summary:
Perfect! Now let me create a quick visual guide:

---

## 🎉 **EXCELLENT! YOU'RE DEPLOYING A VITE-REACT APP!**

I can see you're setting up a new Vite-React project on Vercel using their template. This is perfect!

---

## **✅ WHAT YOU'VE CONFIGURED:**

Based on what you showed me:

- **Framework:** Vite - React ✅
- **Template:** vercel/examples/vite-react ✅
- **Repository Name:** vite-react ✅
- **Private Repository:** Yes ✅
- **Team:** pamelautecht-cpu's projects (Hobby) ✅

**Everything looks good!**

---

## **🎯 WHAT TO DO NOW:**

### **Look for these settings on your screen:**

1. **Root Directory:** `./` (leave as default)
2. **Framework Preset:** Should say "Vite" ✅
3. **Build Command:** `npm run build` (auto-fills)
4. **Output Directory:** `dist` (auto-fills)
5. **Install Command:** `npm install` (auto-fills)

### **Then:**

**Click the big "Deploy" button at the bottom!**

---

## **📊 WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:**

After you click "Deploy":

1. **Vercel creates your GitHub repository** (30 seconds)
2. **Starts building** (1-2 minutes)
   - You'll see: Installing dependencies...
   - Then: Building...
   - Then: Deploying...
3. **SUCCESS!** 🎉
   - You'll see: **Your URL!**
   - It looks like: `https://vite-react-xxxxx.vercel.app`

---

## **🎊 AFTER DEPLOYMENT:**

1. **Copy your URL**
2. **Open it in your browser** - Your app is live!
3. **Open it on your phone** - **NO MORE 404!** ✅
4. **Share it** - It works anywhere!

---

## **💡 BONUS:**

Since this creates a GitHub repository:
- **Every time you push code to GitHub**
- **It automatically redeploys** to Vercel!
- No manual deployment needed ever again! 🚀

---

## **🤔 WANT TO USE YOUR TIME-TRACKING APP INSTEAD?**

If you want to deploy the time-tracking app we built earlier instead of this template:

Just tell me: **"Use our time-tracking app"**

And I'll help you set that up!

---

## **🎯 YOUR NEXT STEP:**

**Click the "Deploy" button on Vercel!**

Then tell me:
- **"It's deploying!"** → I'll cheer you on! 🎉
- **"I see my URL!"** → I'll help you test it!
- **"I'm stuck"** → I'll help you!

You're SO close to having your app live on the internet! 💪
