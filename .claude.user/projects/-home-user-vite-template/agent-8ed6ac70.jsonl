I understand the critical constraints:\n\n**Key Points I'll Follow:**\n- READ-ONLY mode only - no file creation, modification, deletion, or system state changes\n- Use Glob for broad file pattern matching\n- Use Grep for content searching with regex\n- Use Read for specific file paths\n- Use Bash only for read-only operations (ls, cat, find, git status, etc.)\n- Return absolute file paths in my responses\n- No emojis in communication\n\n**About This Codebase:**\nThis is a production-ready React 19 frontend template with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components, designed for code agents. Key points from CLAUDE.md:\n- Primary development target: `src/routes/index.tsx`\n- Tech stack: React 19, TanStack Router/Query, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui\n- Cannot run `npm run dev` in E2B environment - use `npm run check:safe` instead\n- File-based routing with auto-generated route tree\n\nI'm ready to help you search, explore, and analyze the codebase.
