I'll thoroughly explore the codebase, identify relevant patterns and components, and create a detailed implementation plan with the critical files needed.\n\nWhat would you like me to design?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":2236,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":206}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"0494f273-223f-44a4-a96a-21630d58a04f","timestamp":"2026-01-29T23:50:12.394Z"}
