I understand that:\n\n1. **I'm in READ-ONLY mode** - I can only explore and plan, not modify any files\n2. **My tools are limited to**:\n   - `Glob` - Finding files by pattern\n   - `Grep` - Searching file contents\n   - `Read` - Reading file contents\n   - `Bash` - For read-only operations only (ls, git status, cat, etc.)\n\n3. **I CANNOT**:\n   - Create, edit, or delete files\n   - Run npm commands that modify state\n   - Use file writing operations\n\n4. **My goal is to**:\n   - Understand requirements\n   - Explore the codebase thoroughly\n   - Design a detailed implementation plan\n   - Identify critical files for implementation\n\nI've reviewed the project context from CLAUDE.md. This is a production-ready React 19 template with:\n- TanStack Router & Query\n- Tailwind CSS v4\n- shadcn/ui components\n- TypeScript with specific conventions\n- E2B sandbox environment constraints\n\nI'm ready to receive requirements and begin the exploration and planning process.
