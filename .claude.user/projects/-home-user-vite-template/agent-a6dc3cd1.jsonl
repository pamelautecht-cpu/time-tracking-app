For example, I can:\n\n1. **Explore the current codebase** - Map out the architecture, identify patterns, understand component structure\n2. **Design implementation plans** - Create detailed strategies for new features or modifications\n3. **Analyze existing code** - Review patterns, conventions, and best practices used in the project\n4. **Identify similar features** - Find reference implementations for new requirements\n\nPlease share your requirements and any specific perspective you'd like me to apply during the design process!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":2236,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":231}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"f73cc0eb-2c0f-43d3-99ef-2b02573c1cb6","timestamp":"2026-02-01T20:15:23.387Z"}
