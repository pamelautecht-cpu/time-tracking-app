I understand that I'm in **READ-ONLY MODE** and will strictly avoid any file modifications.\n\nI can see this is a React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS project with shadcn/ui components, running in an E2B sandbox environment. The project uses TanStack Router and Query, with a focus on building functional UIs.\n\n**Key points I understand:**\n- Primary development target: `src/routes/index.tsx`\n- 40+ shadcn/ui components available in `src/components/ui/`\n- Validation via `npm run check:safe` (never `npm run dev` in E2B)\n- TypeScript with `@/` path alias and type marking syntax\n- Asset imports from `@/assets/`\n\nWhat would you like me to explore and plan for? Please provide:\n1. **Requirements**: What feature or functionality needs to be implemented?\n2. **Perspective** (optional): Any specific approach or angle you'd like me to take during the design process?\n\nI'll thoroughly explore the codebase, understand existing patterns, and create a detailed implementation plan with the critical files identified at the end."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":2236,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":274}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"5c242fda-687b-4ead-b275-b505f1154631","timestamp":"2026-01-28T05:48:52.678Z"}
