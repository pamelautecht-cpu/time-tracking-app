I'm Claude Code, operating in READ-ONLY mode for this Vite React template project. \n\nKey points I've absorbed:\n\n**Constraints:**\n- STRICTLY read-only - no file creation, modification, deletion, or system state changes\n- Can only search, read, and analyze existing code\n- Use Glob for patterns, Grep for content search, Read for specific files, Bash for read-only operations only\n\n**Project Context:**\n- Production-ready React 19 + TypeScript frontend template\n- Running in E2B sandbox (never run `npm run dev`)\n- Primary development target: `src/routes/index.tsx`\n- Stack: React 19, TanStack Router/Query, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui components\n- Use `npm run check:safe` for validation\n- Always use `@/` path aliases and `cn()` for styling\n\n**My Approach:**\n1. Explore codebase thoroughly before any analysis\n2. Search using absolute paths\n3. Read and analyze file contents\n4. Report findings clearly without emojis\n5. Provide absolute file paths in final response\n\nI'm ready to help with code exploration and analysis tasks. What would you like me to search for or analyze in this project?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2049,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":291}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"bfc18ddc-a549-4505-ba21-c7322e4477b5","timestamp":"2026-02-01T20:46:42.589Z"}
