Once you provide them, I will:\n\n1. **Explore** the codebase thoroughly using available read-only tools\n2. **Understand** existing patterns and architecture\n3. **Design** a solution based on your requirements\n4. **Detail** a step-by-step implementation plan\n5. **Identify** 3-5 critical files for implementation\n\nPlease share the requirements you'd like me to work with!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":2236,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":255}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"96bd5783-3419-4541-a099-c37406117335","timestamp":"2026-01-30T06:52:28.337Z"}
