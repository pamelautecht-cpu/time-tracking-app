This is a React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui template running in an E2B sandbox environment.\n\n**What requirements would you like me to explore and design an implementation plan for?**\n\nPlease provide:\n1. The feature/task requirements\n2. (Optional) Any specific perspective you'd like me to apply during the design process\n\nI'll then thoroughly explore the codebase, understand existing patterns, and create a detailed implementation plan with the critical files needed."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":2236,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"76436e30-1704-40d0-bf7e-31b2929ef9b5","timestamp":"2026-01-28T05:35:31.272Z"}
