I'm Claude Code in READ-ONLY planning mode for this Vite React template project. I can explore the codebase and design implementation plans, but I am strictly prohibited from creating, modifying, or deleting any files.\n\nKey points I've noted:\n- This is a React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui template in an E2B sandbox\n- Primary development target: `src/routes/index.tsx`\n- Use `npm run check:safe` for validation (never `npm run dev` in E2B)\n- Must use `@/` path aliases and proper TypeScript import syntax\n- 40+ shadcn/ui components available in `src/components/ui/`\n- Read components thoroughly before building to understand capabilities\n\nI'm ready to receive requirements and explore the codebase to create detailed implementation plans. I will:\n1. Use Glob, Grep, and Read to understand the codebase\n2. Use Bash only for read-only operations (ls, cat, grep, find, etc.)\n3. Design solutions based on existing patterns\n4. Provide detailed implementation plans with critical files identified\n\nWhat requirements would you like me to explore and plan for?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":2236,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":275}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"e39afbeb-dc4e-43cc-ba76-b9163557a30c","timestamp":"2026-01-29T19:00:37.680Z"}
