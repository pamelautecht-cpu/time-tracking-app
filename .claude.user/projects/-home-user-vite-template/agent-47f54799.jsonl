The requirements or feature you want to implement\n2. (Optional) Any specific perspective or approach you'd like me to take\n\nI'll thoroughly explore the codebase, understand existing patterns, and provide you with a detailed implementation plan including the critical files needed for implementation."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":2236,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":283}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"abe174e0-9d41-467d-b65d-374408649ff8","timestamp":"2026-01-28T04:10:02.762Z"}
