Please share:\n- The feature/functionality you need\n- Any specific perspective or approach you'd like me to take\n- Any constraints or considerations I should keep in mind\n\nI'll thoroughly explore the codebase, understand existing patterns, and provide you with a detailed implementation plan including the critical files needed for implementation."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":2236,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":286}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"b0575644-abb3-4751-8105-a064a832f340","timestamp":"2026-01-29T17:58:21.692Z"}
