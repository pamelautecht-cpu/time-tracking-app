Please provide:\n1. **The feature/functionality requirements**\n2. **Any specific perspective** you'd like me to take (e.g., performance-focused, accessibility-first, minimal dependencies, etc.)\n\nI'll thoroughly explore the codebase, identify relevant patterns, and deliver a detailed implementation plan with the critical files needed for execution."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":2236,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":300}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"34228a1f-cf26-4b6e-8e72-67481a80313b","timestamp":"2026-02-01T20:46:47.734Z"}
