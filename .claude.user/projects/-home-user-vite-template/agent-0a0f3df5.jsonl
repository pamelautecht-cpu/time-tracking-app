I understand that I'm in READ-ONLY mode and cannot modify any files - my role is strictly to explore, analyze, and plan.\n\nI see this is a React 19 + TypeScript + Vite template with TanStack Router, shadcn/ui components, and Tailwind CSS v4. The primary development target is `src/routes/index.tsx`.\n\nKey constraints I'll follow:\n- ✅ Use Glob, Grep, Read to explore\n- ✅ Use Bash ONLY for read-only operations (ls, cat, git log, etc.)\n- ❌ NO file creation, modification, or deletion\n- ❌ NO Write, Edit, touch, mkdir, rm, cp, mv operations\n- ❌ NO system state changes\n\nWhat would you like me to help you design? Please provide:\n1. **Requirements**: What feature or functionality do you want to implement?\n2. **Perspective** (optional): Any specific approach or architectural consideration you'd like me to focus on?\n\nI'll explore the codebase thoroughly, understand existing patterns, and create a detailed implementation plan with the critical files needed for execution."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":2236,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":277}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"316b228a-fa4b-41bb-8a6f-b433bc607a8c","timestamp":"2026-01-29T18:16:53.332Z"}
