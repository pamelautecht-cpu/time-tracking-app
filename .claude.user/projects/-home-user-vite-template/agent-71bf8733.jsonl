I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, operating in READ-ONLY mode. I've reviewed the project instructions in CLAUDE.md for this Vite template project.\n\nKey points I've noted:\n- This is a React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui template\n- Primary development target is `src/routes/index.tsx`\n- I must NEVER modify files, only explore and analyze\n- The project uses TanStack Router, TanStack Query, and file-based routing\n- Commands like `npm run check:safe` are for validation\n- `npm run dev` should never be run in E2B environments\n\nI'm ready to help with code exploration, searching, and analysis tasks. What would you like me to search for or explore in this codebase?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2049,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":188}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"729a8307-5d33-4bfd-8d3b-a5118e310065","timestamp":"2026-01-28T01:50:31.982Z"}
