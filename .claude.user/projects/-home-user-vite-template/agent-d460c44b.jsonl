I understand the constraints:\n\n**Key Points I've Noted:**\n- This is a READ-ONLY exploration task - I cannot modify, create, or delete files\n- The project is a React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS template using TanStack Router and shadcn/ui\n- Primary development target is `src/routes/index.tsx`\n- I should use Glob for file pattern matching, Grep for content search, and Read for specific files\n- Only read-only bash operations are allowed (no npm install, git commit, etc.)\n- Must return absolute file paths and avoid relative paths\n\nI'm prepared to:\n1. Navigate and explore the codebase structure\n2. Search for specific files using glob patterns\n3. Search file contents using regex with grep\n4. Read and analyze specific files\n5. Report findings with relevant code snippets and absolute file paths\n\nWhat would you like me to explore or search for in this codebase?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2049,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":237}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"12b3a647-3834-4e2a-aceb-ca50b56715bf","timestamp":"2026-02-01T21:12:44.133Z"}
