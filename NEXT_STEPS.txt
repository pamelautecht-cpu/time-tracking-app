================================================================================
              ✅ GITHUB REPO CREATED! NOW UPLOAD THE CODE
================================================================================

Great! You created the GitHub repository "time-tracking-app"

Now you need to UPLOAD the code to that repository.

================================================================================
                        WHERE YOU ARE NOW
================================================================================

✅ GitHub repository created: time-tracking-app
✅ Code is ready and committed locally
⏳ NEXT: Upload code to GitHub
⏳ THEN: Import to Vercel

================================================================================
                    STEP 1: UPLOAD CODE TO GITHUB
================================================================================

You're on the GitHub page for your new "time-tracking-app" repository.

You should see a screen that says:
"Quick setup — if you've done this kind of thing before"

Look for the section that says:
"…or push an existing repository from the command line"

IT WILL SHOW COMMANDS LIKE:

git remote add origin https://github.com/pamelautecht-cpu/time-tracking-app.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

✅ I've already done the first two steps!
⏳ Now YOU need to push the code

================================================================================
                    HOW TO PUSH THE CODE
================================================================================

OPTION A: Using Command Line
-----------------------------

If you have terminal/command line access to /home/user/vite-template/:

1. Open terminal
2. Navigate to: cd /home/user/vite-template
3. Run: git push -u origin main
4. Enter your GitHub username: pamelautecht-cpu
5. Enter your GitHub password (or Personal Access Token)
6. Done!

⚠️ IMPORTANT: You'll need a GitHub Personal Access Token, not your password
   Get it from: https://github.com/settings/tokens

---

OPTION B: Using GitHub Desktop
-------------------------------

1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Click File → Add Local Repository
3. Choose folder: /home/user/vite-template
4. Click "Publish repository" button (top right)
5. Make sure "time-tracking-app" is the name
6. Click "Publish Repository"
7. Done!

---

OPTION C: Upload Files via GitHub Website
------------------------------------------

Since the code is on a server at /home/user/vite-template/, you need to:

1. **Download the code to your computer:**
   - Access /home/user/vite-template/ folder
   - Download ALL files
   - Save to your Desktop or Documents

2. **Upload to GitHub:**
   - On GitHub page for "time-tracking-app"
   - Look for: "uploading an existing file"
   - Click it
   - Drag ALL downloaded files
   - Scroll down
   - Click "Commit changes"

================================================================================
                    STEP 2: AFTER CODE IS ON GITHUB
================================================================================

Once the code is uploaded to GitHub:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com

2. Click "Add New..." → "Project"

3. You'll see your GitHub repositories

4. Find "time-tracking-app"

5. Click "Import" next to it

6. Configure:
   - Framework: Vite
   - Build Command: npm run build
   - Output Directory: dist

7. Click "Deploy"

8. WAIT 1-2 MINUTES

9. YOU'LL GET A URL! 🎉

10. Open that URL on your phone!

================================================================================
                        CAN'T PUSH THE CODE?
================================================================================

PROBLEM: The code is on a server, not your computer

SOLUTIONS:

1. If you have terminal access:
   - SSH into the server
   - cd /home/user/vite-template
   - git push -u origin main

2. If you can download files:
   - Download /home/user/vite-template/ folder
   - Upload via GitHub web interface (Option C above)

3. If you have GitHub Desktop:
   - Clone the empty repository
   - Download /home/user/vite-template/ files
   - Copy files to cloned repo
   - Commit and push
