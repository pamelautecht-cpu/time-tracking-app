                    🚀 DON'T WORRY - I'LL HELP YOU!
================================================================================

I know this is confusing. Let me make it SUPER SIMPLE.

You have 2 EASY options:

================================================================================
OPTION 1: I'll Try to Deploy It For You (Command Line)
================================================================================

I can try to deploy it automatically using a command.

You'll need to:
1. Give me your email address
2. Check your email for a verification link
3. Click the link
4. I'll do the rest!

Want me to try this? Just tell me your email!

================================================================================
OPTION 2: You Do It On Vercel Website (Very Easy)
================================================================================

This is actually THE EASIEST way and you can do it yourself:

STEP 1: Open Your Web Browser
------------------------------
On your desktop, open Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge.

STEP 2: Go to Vercel
--------------------
Type this in the address bar:
https://vercel.com

Press Enter.

STEP 3: Sign Up
---------------
Click the "Sign Up" button (top right corner).

Choose ONE:
- Sign up with GitHub (if you have GitHub account)
- Sign up with Email (if you don't have GitHub)

Follow the instructions to create account.

STEP 4: Find Your Project Folder
---------------------------------
On your computer, find the folder called:
vite-template

It should be at:
/home/user/vite-template

(Or wherever you saved this project)

STEP 5: Drag It to Vercel
--------------------------
1. After logging into Vercel, click "Add New..." → "Project"
2. You'll see a page with upload area
3. Open your file explorer/finder
4. Find the "vite-template" folder
5. DRAG the whole folder onto the Vercel webpage
6. DROP it there

STEP 6: Click Deploy
---------------------
1. Vercel will show you some settings
2. Everything should be pre-filled correctly
3. Just click the big "Deploy" button
4. WAIT 2 minutes

STEP 7: Get Your URL
--------------------
After 2 minutes, you'll see:

    🎉 CONGRATULATIONS! 🎊
    
    https://time-tracking-xyz.vercel.app  ⬅️ YOUR URL!
    
    [ Visit ]

COPY that URL!

STEP 8: Use on Your Phone
--------------------------
1. On your phone, open browser
2. Type that URL
3. NO MORE 404! ✅

================================================================================
WHICH SHOULD YOU DO?
================================================================================

OPTION 1 (I help with command line):
- Need to give me your email
- I run commands for you
- You just verify your email

OPTION 2 (You do it on website):
- Super easy, visual
- Just drag and drop
- No technical stuff
- RECOMMENDED! ⭐

================================================================================
LET'S START!
================================================================================

Tell me:
1. Do you want me to try Option 1 (give me your email)?
2. Or will you try Option 2 (website - easier)?

If you choose Option 2, I'll give you a simple checklist to follow!

Don't worry - I'm here to help every step of the way! 💪
