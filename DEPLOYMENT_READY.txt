HOW TO DEPLOY TO YOUR VERCEL PROJECT:
================================================================================

Since you're creating a new Vercel project from the template, here's what to do:

OPTION 1: Deploy Template First, Update Later (RECOMMENDED)
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Click "Deploy" in Vercel (with current settings)
2. Wait for deployment to complete
3. You'll get a URL and a GitHub repository
4. Tell me your GitHub repo URL
5. I'll give you the code to push
6. The time-tracking app will auto-deploy!

OPTION 2: I Can Give You The Code Now
--------------------------------------

Tell me: "Give me the code now"

I'll create the full time-tracking app code and you can:
1. Copy it to your local computer
2. Push it to the GitHub repo Vercel creates
3. It deploys automatically!

================================================================================
NEXT STEP:
================================================================================

In Vercel, click "Deploy"!

After it finishes:
- You'll get a URL like: https://vite-react-xxx.vercel.app
- And a GitHub repository

Then tell me:
"I deployed it! My URL is: [your-url]"

And I'll help you update it with the time-tracking app! 🚀
