## 🗑️ How to Delete an Employee

- ⚠️ Their time cards will remain in the system (for payroll history)

### Step-by-Step:

```
1. Go to "Employees" tab
   ↓
2. Find the employee you want to delete
   ↓
3. Click the red trash icon (🗑️) next to their name
   ↓
4. Confirmation dialog appears:
   ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ ⚠️ Delete Employee                   │
   │                                      │
   │ Are you sure you want to delete      │
   │ this employee?                       │
   │                                      │

   └──────────────────────────────────────┘
   ↓
5. Click "Delete" to confirm
   ↓
6. ✅ Employee is removed from the list
```

### What Happens When You Delete:

- ✅ Employee is removed from employee list
- ✅ They can no longer select their account to clock in
- ✅ Their historical time cards remain in the database
- ✅ Past reports still show their data
- ❌ They cannot create new time cards

### Best Practice:

Instead of deleting, consider:
- Keep terminated employees in the system for historical records
- Or: Export all their time card data before deleting

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the Employees tab!"
**Solution:** Make sure you're logged in as a **Manager**. Only managers can access the Employees tab.

### "I can't delete an employee!"
**Solution:** Make sure you're logged in as a Manager. Only managers can delete employees.

### "The Add Employee button is not working!"
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're on the "Employees" tab
2. Make sure you're logged in as a Manager
3. Try refreshing the page

### "I deleted someone by mistake!"
**Solution:** Unfortunately, there's no undo. You'll need to add them back:
1. Click "+ Add Employee"
2. Re-enter their information
3. Note: Their old time cards should still exist in the system

### "Can I add the same person twice?"
**Yes, technically,** but you shouldn't! The app doesn't prevent duplicate names, so be careful to check if someone is already in the list before adding them.

### "What if I forget someone's email?"
**Solution:** You can use a placeholder email like:
- `employee@company.com`
- `temp@company.com`
- Then edit it later when you get the real email

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Prepare a List First
Before starting, create a spreadsheet with:
- Employee names
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- Role (Employee or Manager)

This makes adding everyone much faster!

### Tip 2: Start with Managers
Add all managers first, then employees. This way managers can help add their team members.

### Tip 3: Use Consistent Formatting
- Names: "First Last" (e.g., "John Smith")
- Emails: Use company email addresses
- Phones: Use same format (e.g., "+1 (555) 123-4567")

### Tip 4: Don't Delete, Keep for Records
Unless you have a specific reason to delete, keep terminated employees in the system for historical payroll records.

### Tip 5: Test with Yourself First
Add yourself as a test employee, try clocking in/out, then delete or edit it to make sure you understand the process.
